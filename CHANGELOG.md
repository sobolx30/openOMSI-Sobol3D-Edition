## Unreleased

### Changed
- Driving physics, friction circle [ROLLBACK circle-1]: **a tyre's grip across is what its brake or drive leaves it.** Omsi.exe keeps the sideways grip whole whatever the tyre spends along itself, and so did the rigid body: a bus braked to a slide with its left wheels on the grass lost speed at the mean of the two grips but kept its heading to the degree, because the locked tyres still held the full mu x load across. The lateral constraint's cap is now sqrt((mu N)² - F_long²) per tyre (`RigidBody::step_slice`, `friction_circle`): a locked or spinning tyre holds nothing across, like a puck, so the split-grip slide pulls towards the asphalt side and wheelspin lets the back step out. `OMSI_NO_FRICTION_CIRCLE=1` keeps the two apart as Omsi.exe does (A/B). Braking to a slide from 54 km/h with the left tyres on the verge turns the bus more than 2 degrees towards the asphalt in two seconds, and not at all without the circle (test). `omsi-sim/src/rigid.rs`.
- Driving physics, grip per tyre [ROLLBACK grip-1]: **each tyre has the grip of what it stands on.** OMSI's tyres know one road (ode.dll gets one friction for the world from `StreetCond`), and so did ours: a bus with two wheels on the verge braked as on asphalt and a driven wheel on wet cobbles never spun first. Every face the wheels can stand on now carries what it is made of, read off the name of the texture it is drawn with (`omsi_geometry::SurfaceKind`, `scene::surface_class`: asphalt, concrete, paving - setts and slabs -, kerb, soft ground; the terrain itself is soft ground, a height profile or collision mesh nobody classified keeps the road's grip), the wheel lookup keeps it per triangle (`DriveGrid::class_at`) and the ground answers once a slice per wheel what the tyre is on and how deep in a puddle it stands (`Ground::surface`, `DriveGround`, the puddle mask the renderer draws, `puddles::water_at`). The tyre scales the weather's friction by it (`RigidBody::tyre_grip`: setts 0.8 dry and 0.65 wet, grass 0.55 and 0.4, a kerb 0.9, down towards 0.35 at the heart of a puddle - no aquaplaning yet) and every place the step used the one friction - the longitudinal clamp, the wheel's slip and lock, the sideways cap, the holding threshold - takes the tyre's own. `OMSI_UNIFORM_GRIP=1` gives every tyre the road's one friction again (A/B). A bus sliding on locked wheels with its left tyres on the grass now loses 0.7 g instead of 0.85 (test). `omsi-geometry/src/lib.rs`, `omsi-sim/src/rigid.rs`, `omsi-sim/src/vehicle.rs`, `omsi-app/src/scene.rs`, `spawn.rs`, `traffic.rs`, `app_events.rs`, `offscreen.rs`. Bare terrain reads what the ground brush painted on it: the tile's paint masks are summed into a coarse raster of kinds (`omsi_geometry::GroundPaint`, `World::ground_paint`, built with the tile's terrain and dropped with it), so a car park painted asphalt or a side street painted cobbles grips as such - and may hold a puddle - where it used to be grass.
- Driving physics, open differential [ROLLBACK diff-1]: **a driven wheel that spins takes the drive of the one across the axle.** `M_Wheel` went to every driven wheel in a fixed share whatever its partner did (as Omsi.exe hands it out), so a bus with one rear wheel on ice still had half its drive at the other, and an ASR script never saw the case it is written for. A bus axle is an open differential: both sides get the same torque, so the side with grip passes on no more than the spinning side's sliding friction, and nothing while its partner hangs in the air and takes the whole torque into its own spin (`RigidBody::step_slice`, before the tyre forces; `open_diff`). `Velocity` and `n_Wheel` stay the mean of the driven wheels, so the spinning one shows to the scripts. `OMSI_NO_DIFF=1` restores the fixed shares (A/B). With the left rear in a puddle on the grass the bus pulls away at under two thirds of what the fixed shares gave (test). `omsi-sim/src/rigid.rs`.
- Driving physics, rolling resistance [ROLLBACK rolling-1]: **the tyres roll against their load, their speed and their ground.** `[rollwiderstand]` was one constant split evenly over the wheels: a full bus on fresh snow rolled like an empty one on asphalt, and at 100 km/h like at a walk. The file's value is now what the unladen vehicle rolls against standing on asphalt, and each tyre takes its coefficient x its load x (1 + v / 30 m/s) x what it rolls on (setts 1.3, a kerb 1.2, soft ground 3, snow from 2 to 4 by `StreetCond`), `RigidBody::rolling_force`; the coupled sections of an articulated bus the same with their own coefficient (`CoupledPart::crr`). Standing unladen on asphalt the tyres' shares sum exactly to the file's value (test); passengers, the extra load on an axle on a grade and speed add theirs. `omsi-sim/src/rigid.rs`, `omsi-sim/src/vehicle.rs`.
- The best weather has a few clouds [ROLLBACK cavok-1]: **#CAVOK.owt ("Bestes Wetter") is now read with a few cumulus clouds** instead of none (`Weather::parse` in `omsi-content/src/weather.rs`: a weather named that, or with that file name, whose `[clouds]` is -1 gets "Cumulus 1"; a file with clouds of its own keeps them). Before it, a player who picked it from the launcher or the weather window (only the start without any weather chosen had the clouds) drove under an empty sky and missed what the clouds bring: the shadows, the light, the moving sky. It holds in every place a weather is read: the start, the weather window, `weather set`, the cycle. The Clouds setting still turns them off, and the weather window's "Cloud type: None" still gives a sky without any. `weather.rs` (with a test).
- Sunrise and sunset [ROLLBACK twilight-1]: **more of the atmosphere of the two hours.** *The sky* (Enhanced, and the Vanilla pictures with the new sky; `twilight_sky` in `sky_enhanced.wgsl`, drawn over the finished sky, not in the cube): **the earth's shadow** rises on the side opposite the sun while the sun is from a degree above to six below the horizon, a blue-grey arch with a soft top edge (the sky table had it only as a faint blur), the **belt of Venus** over it, a pink band; and **rays** fan out from the point opposite the sun when scattered clouds are about (a few bright rays between wider gaps, 7 % at most, only with a low sun). The sun's **disc** low in the sky is flattened by up to an eighth (the refraction) and its rim ripples a little; on about one clear, clean, dry day in five or six it shows a **green rim** in its last moment (`twilight.x` of the Enhanced uniform, from the calendar day). Behind thin high cloud (the weather's veil) the sun has the 22 degree **halo** (reddish inside) and, within eight degrees of the horizon, a **sun pillar**. *The clouds* (`cloud_underlight`): with the sun low, the glowing horizon on its side lights their undersides warm. *The air:* a low sun shines more strongly forward through fog and haze (`air_of`: the phase 0.7 and a third more light, a street in golden mist), the **morning's air is cleaner** (a sixth less haze, a finer particle: pastel, crisp) **and the evening's dustier** (a fifth more, a coarser one: a warmer, redder sun), and **a morning mist** comes on many mornings, above all in autumn (about three in five in October, one in three in high summer; a visibility of five kilometres down to two, from the first light, thickest at sunrise, gone by the time the sun is 20 degrees up: `omsi_sim::mist`, added to the weather's fog density in `lights::lighting_from`, so every picture has it; `OMSI_NO_MIST=1` turns it off). The crowns of trees glow more against a low sun (the translucency of foliage, `enhanced.wgsl`). The strengths of the sky effects are the `TW_*` constants at the end of `sky_enhanced.wgsl` (1 as designed, 0 off). The cost is under a few tenths of a millisecond and only while the sun is within some degrees of the horizon. The Enhanced uniform grew by a vec4 (`twilight`). `sky_enhanced.wgsl`, `enhanced_common.wgsl`, `enhanced.wgsl`, `lib.rs`, `omsi-sim/src/mist.rs` (with tests), `lights.rs`.
- Thunderstorm, third pass [ROLLBACK storm-3]: **the sky's faces no longer blink.** The flash was added to the sky harmonics and the fog colour of the Enhanced uniform, which the sky cube's pass reads too (the clouds' ambient light, the air in front of them); the cube is drawn a face a frame and kept for many, so every face kept the flash of the frame it was drawn in - six squares of the sky blinking at their own times, and a fade that went down in steps as the faces were redrawn. The uniform now also carries the flash's own terms (`flash`, `flash_dir`, 32 bytes appended to `Enhanced` in `lib.rs` and `enhanced_common.wgsl`) and the cube's pass (`sky_pass`, set in `fs_sky_cube`) takes them out of `sh_irradiance` and the fog; the flash reaches the sky only through `lightning_layer`, at the picture's own resolution, every frame (the scene, the fog and the reflection probe, which is made from the cube, as before). **Far strikes are the common ones now:** 0.8 to 20.8 km (a mild storm; 15.8 a fierce one), about one in eleven within 4 km and half beyond 12 km (storm-1: 0.7 to 9 km, mostly near); a far thunder is quieter than a near one but audible (gain 1.15 / (1 + 0.2 km), 0.2 at the least), and arrives as late as sound does (20 km: a minute). **Not the same recording twice running:** the last two played are left out of the draw when the distance's group has others (`pick_thunder`); the pitch varies by 93 to 107 %. `lib.rs`, `enhanced_common.wgsl`, `sky_enhanced.wgsl`, `storm.rs`, `storm_fx.rs`, `ambience.rs`.
- Rain in a wind [ROLLBACK rainwind-1]: **the streaks of rain lean the way the drops fall.** The drops fell aslant in a wind (9 m/s down, the wind sideways) but each streak was drawn upright, so the rain seemed to slide sideways on upright strokes. A streak now lies along the drop's path: `rain.rs` sends the unit vector of the velocity in the sprite's direction (`Corona::direction`, which a streak did not use), and `corona.wgsl` turns the streak about that axis to face the eye (the quad's width is across the axis and the line of sight, so a streak leaning across the view does not flatten). Without a wind it is upright as before. The camera's own motion is not added (a bus at speed does not slant the rain). `rain.rs`, `corona.wgsl`.
- Thunderstorm, second pass [ROLLBACK storm-2]: **three repairs.** *The sky no longer looks like a box in a flash:* the light of a flash on the clouds was taken from the alpha of the cloud cube (refined a face at a time with jitter, 1024 per face), which showed its edges and steps; it is now a procedural cover (`lightning_cover`: a smooth dome round the bolt, brighter and wider near the strike, with a few slow billows from a noise that does not depend on the cube), and the layer is dithered (`fs_enhanced_ldr`) so that a dim flash does not band. *The fade is smooth:* the flash was a sum of exponentials that began with a jump and the frame-to-frame values dropped in a few coarse steps; the profile now rises in 6 ms and dies away in two exponentials (70 ms and 0.4 s) with a soft ceiling for the strokes that overlap, and what the picture gets is smoothed on release (the light 0.1 s, the bolt 0.05 s), so the dimming runs on every frame instead of by steps (`Strike::flash` returns the light and the bolt apart; a test checks that no frame jumps by more than a quarter). *Recorded thunder:* `.wav` files in **`assets/sounds/thunder/`** are compiled into the executable (`build.rs` writes the list, `ambience.rs` includes it; any rate, mono or stereo, 8/16/24/32-bit or float) and are played instead of the made-up thunder; a `Sounds\Thunder\` folder in the content root, if it holds `.wav` files, replaces them (for a player who wants his own). The name says the distance: `near*`/`close*` (a strike under 4 km), `mid*` (4 to 12 km), `far*`/`distant*` (over 12 km); a file with any other name serves every distance. One is drawn at random and played at a pitch of 95 to 105 %; they are brought to one level at load, the strength comes from the storm's distance as before; a far one loses its highs (a lowpass from 8 km), from the cab all are muffled. Without the folder the made-up thunder plays as in storm-1. `storm.rs`, `storm_fx.rs`, `ambience.rs`, `sky_enhanced.wgsl`.
- Thunderstorm [ROLLBACK storm-1]: **lightning, thunder and a flash on the scene, called up by hand** from the World window's Sky page ("Storm strength", "Storm duration", "Thunderstorm" Start / Stop; the conditions in which one comes of itself are for later). The storm rises in 20 s, strikes at random while it lasts (every 4 to 20 seconds by its strength, now and then two in quick succession; the stronger, the nearer: 0.7 to 9 km) and thins out at its end. Each strike has its own direction, distance and kind (about two in three reach the ground, the rest flash within the cloud) and two to four return strokes within a quarter of a second. **In the sky:** a jagged bolt with forks from the cloud base to the ground, seen as tall as the distance makes it (`lightning_layer` in `sky_enhanced.wgsl`, drawn in the tangent plane of the sky at the bolt's middle), and the clouds lit by it, a broad glow that dies away in a fraction of a second. **On the scene:** the Enhanced picture gets the flash as a bluish-white light in its sky harmonics and fog (40 % from all round, 60 % from the strike's direction; bounded by the exposure, so that by night the street lights up as by day and by day the flash is hardly seen), the Vanilla picture as a burst of ambient light. **Thunder:** made up (`omsi_audio::thunder`: the crack of a near strike, the rumble rolling on in swells for 3 to 9 seconds, duller and longer the farther, made on a helper thread) and played after the flash by the time sound takes to come the distance (343 m/s: 3 km, 9 seconds), quieter and muffled from the cab. The bolt and the lit clouds are drawn by the new sky only (Enhanced; Vanilla and Vanilla+ with `new_sky`); the old sky shows the light on the scene and the thunder. The camera uniform grew by two vec4 (864 bytes; `bolt`, `bolt2`). `omsi-sim/src/storm.rs` and `omsi-audio/src/thunder.rs` (with tests), `omsi-app/src/storm_fx.rs`, `ambience.rs`, `app_events.rs`, `game_lists.rs`, `input_script.rs`, `omsi-render` (`Lighting::lightning*`, `prepare_enhanced`, `shader.wgsl`, `sky.wgsl`, `sky_enhanced.wgsl`).
- Shooting stars [ROLLBACK meteors-1]: **now and then a meteor crosses the night sky**: three independent lanes (slots of 47, 76 and 105 seconds, a meteor in about two slots in five: about one a minute in all), each at a random place and direction (mostly downward), 10 to 25 degrees long in half a second to one and a half, a bright head with a fading trail, white-blue or a little yellow. They show through a hazier sky than the faint stars (by the limiting magnitude) and are dimmed near the horizon like the stars. In the night sky of both pictures (`night_stars` in `stars.wgsl`).
- Aurora, third pass [ROLLBACK aurora-3]: **rarer, greener, and no two displays alike.** *Rarer:* a day's storm index now has an exponential tail (about one day in four hundred reaches Kp 5, one in ten thousand Kp 7) and a glow under a quarter of the sky's strength is left out, so Szczecin sees one on about seven nights a year and a big one once in some years; the setting `aurora` at 2 brings them much oftener (+1.2 Kp). A place under the oval still has one nearly every night. *Colours:* up to a strength of 100 % the aurora is the green alone; the red of the upper levels and the violet-pink lower fringe join only above it (full at 145 %), and above 100 % the strength adds colour more than light. *Each event has a look of its own* (a seed, drawn per night for a natural one and per start for the manual one, carried in the camera's `fx.w` beside the distance): the direction of its arcs (up to 30 degrees off the pole, drifting slowly), one to three arcs, thin to thick, calm to lively, red-leaning or not, a violet or pink fringe, and its own rhythm of **break-ups** in the strong displays: a quick brightening that runs out along the arc to both sides with fast flickering rays and livelier folds, and dies away in a quarter of a minute. The rays now follow leaning field lines, so that over a close arc they converge on the magnetic zenith (a corona); the manual display above 100 % comes nearer (130 %: 270 km, 160 %: 40 km, nearly overhead). **The aurora is about 40 % dimmer** (it was too bright against a night sky). **The Sky page of the World window has the same size as the Weather, Time and METAR pages** (its rows had a description line, which gives the window the taller layout of the other pages). `aurora.rs` (with tests), `aurora_fx.rs`, `stars.wgsl` (`au_event`, `au_burst`, `aurora_sky`), `sky_enhanced.wgsl`, `lib.rs` (`Lighting::aurora_seed`), `game_lists.rs`, `app_events.rs`.
- Aurora, second pass [ROLLBACK aurora-2]: **no more hard edge at the top of the aurora**: the layer is summed up to 330 km (was 260, where the red of the upper levels was cut off), the red fades out between 240 and 320 km, the faint glow round the arc is narrower and the shortcut that leaves out the pixels far from the arc now starts 900 km short of it (it was 260 km, inside the glow's reach: a step from lighter to darker showed along it). **The manual aurora's controls moved to a page of their own** in the World window ("Sky": strength, duration, Start / Stop), so the Weather page is as short as it was and needs no scrolling. `stars.wgsl`, `game_lists.rs`.
- Sun glare, third pass [ROLLBACK sunglare-4]: **the moon glares a fifth as much** (was 0.6 of its veil: a full moon blazed, a half one too); **the glare follows the sun and the moon twice as fast** (smoothing 0.018 s); **a source just off the picture no longer shines through the cab**: how much of it gets in is what the picture's edge nearest to it shows in the depth (`edge_sky`, seven reads along the border: a window lets it in, the roof and the walls do not), for the veil and for the shafts' samples outside the picture; **the sun's rays stay when the sun itself is hidden** behind a tree or a building (they need the sky, not the disc: 70 % of their strength, the rest as the disc shows). `glare.wgsl`, `lib.rs`.
- Moon rays [ROLLBACK moonrays-1]: at night the moon has light shafts too, from its place on the screen through the gaps of a canopy or between buildings (a tenth of the sun's, only with the moon up and clear of cloud). `glare.wgsl`.
- Moonlit clouds [ROLLBACK moonclouds-1]: **by night the moon lights the clouds** - the cloud march takes the moon (its phase and height) for the key light where its irradiance is above what the sun still gives the layer, with the same two-lobe phase: a silver lining round the moon, bright edges and grey bellies instead of clouds lit by the sky alone. The thin high layer follows. In the Enhanced sky and in the Vanilla pictures that draw it. `sky_enhanced.wgsl` (`cloud_layer`).
- Aurora [ROLLBACK aurora-1]: **the night sky has northern lights.** Curtains of green with a red upper edge and a violet lower one, rays upright and flickering, folds travelling along the arc, over the poleward horizon, drawn as light 90-260 km up (a ray is followed through the layer, so they have their parallax), behind the clouds and washed out by a bright sky. **Natural:** the map's place (`[location]`) gives the geomagnetic latitude, the calendar day a Kp index (most days quiet, a storm now and then, always the same on the same day, the evening's substorm at its hour) and from the two the distance of the arc: a place near the pole has one nearly every night, one in mid-latitudes (Szczecin) sees a low glow on a few nights a year, a surprise; no interaction. Setting `aurora` (0..2, launcher and game menu, 1 by default, 0 = never). **By hand:** the World window's Weather page has "Aurora strength", "Aurora duration" and a Start / Stop button: a display on any map, which rises in 25 s, holds and fades. `omsi-sim/src/aurora.rs` (with tests), `omsi-app/src/aurora_fx.rs`, `stars.wgsl` (`aurora_sky`), `sky_enhanced.wgsl` (`aurora_layer`), `lib.rs` (`Lighting::aurora`, `aurora_dist`, the camera's `fx.zw`).
- The Enhanced sky in Vanilla and Vanilla+ [ROLLBACK newsky-1]: **the whole sky of the Enhanced graphics - the physical sky, the volumetric clouds, the sun's disc, the moon with its phases, the stars and the aurora - is now the default of the Vanilla and Vanilla+ pictures**, drawn through a tone curve and the vanilla fog (`fs_enhanced_ldr`, new pipelines `sky_new_pipeline` of the plain passes; the sky cube and the sky table are made in these frames too, the reflection probe is not). The old sky (the envir textures, `fs_main`, `vanilla_night`) stays in the code untouched: setting `new_sky=0` (launcher Graphics page and the game's Options, Vanilla only) or `OMSI_OLD_SKY=1` brings it back, as do OpenGL, VR and the mirrors (which keep the old sky). The sky is exposed up to 20 times a day's exposure, so that a night stays a night. `lib.rs` (`vsky`, `prepare_enhanced`), `sky_enhanced.wgsl`.
- Sun glare and moon [ROLLBACK sunglare-3]: **the glare follows the sun's visibility quickly** (the smoothing of how much of the sun is seen: 0.035 s, was 0.15 s), so a sun covered by a fence, a tree or an object in the camera's turn goes out and comes back at once instead of lingering. **The moon is back as it was in nightsky-1** (the procedural face, `MOON_RADIUS` 0.0062; the photograph, its binding 9 and `moon.gray` are gone); the Milky Way stays toned down. `lib.rs`, `stars.wgsl`.
- Sun glare, crash fixed [ROLLBACK sunglare-3]: the game stopped at start (`Option::unwrap()` on a `None` in `omsi-render/src/lib.rs`) because the glare's wish for the vehicles' depth also switched on the rain-on-glass block, which needs the glass pictures that exist only when there is glass to draw. The depth of the vehicles drawn in model order is now laid under `glass_on || glare_wanted`, the rain block again under `glass_on` alone.
- The night sky, second pass [ROLLBACK nightsky-2]: **the moon's face is a photograph** (`omsi-render/src/moon.gray`, 512 x 512 grey with a mip chain made at load, the sky bind group's binding 9): the seas and craters come from it, lit by the phase as before; the moon is drawn larger (`MOON_RADIUS` 0.0100, was 0.0062) so that the face shows. **The Milky Way is a fraction of what it was** (a few thousandths of white away from the galactic centre, a few hundredths in it) and so are the Andromeda galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds, which stood out as big white blots. `stars.wgsl`, `lib.rs`.
- Sun glare, second pass [ROLLBACK sunglare-2]: **how much of the sun is seen comes from the picture** (the luminance of the sun's disc at 13 points, against what the disc alone has), not from the depth prepass, which knew nothing of a blended sun blind, a tinted pane or a thin cloud: the glare shone through them. A sun blind, a roof, leaves, a cloud now dim it as much as they dim the sun; the light shafts need some of the sun to show (none behind something solid). **The depth the shafts take for occluders now includes the vehicles drawn in model order** (the prepass leaves them out), so the shafts no longer run across a bus's body. `glare.wgsl` (`hdr_seen`, `sun_seen`), `lib.rs`.
- Career Mode, drivers, second pass [ROLLBACK careerstaff-2]: **a job lasts as long as the timetable says** (from the first departure to the last arrival of the courses given, in real time; `JOB_TIME_SCALE` in `staff.rs` scales it) - the fixed 90 s to 15 min is gone. On the Jobs page a driver is given the courses **from the chosen one up to one picked in "until hh:mm · n course(s)"** (at most ten hours in one go; a driver then rests for a third of the shift and cannot be sent meanwhile). **The pay is repaired**: a driver's courses no longer get the series bonus (x1.5, x2 ... x5 was meant for the player at the wheel and made a 28-course job pay 40 000); the wage is a share of what the job brings - about 26 % for a green driver, 35 % for a master, 2 points more for each good trait - and never less than 30 for a course (was a flat sum of about 100 a course); hiring costs 400 + 35 a point of skill (was 250 + 8), the retainer 30 + half the skill (was 10 + a quarter), a training course 250 + 4 a point (was 400 + 8). A bus wears one point per 20 km (was 30). The fares, the series for the player, fuel and repairs are as they were. `staff.rs`, `company.rs` (`settle_with`), `career_jobs.rs`, `career_staff.rs`.
- Career Mode pay, again [ROLLBACK careerpay-2]: the fares are three times what they were (10.8 per km and 21 per stop before the size and difficulty factors; the punctuality bonus follows, the ticket sales, the fuel, the crashes and the repairs are as they were). "New offers" costs 20 (was 250). Both numbers are in the `economy` block of `company.rs`.
- Career Mode pay: fares are about 38 % higher (3.6 per km, 7 per stop before the size and difficulty factors). **Courses in a row** pay more: in one game session the second completed course pays x1.5, the third x2, the fourth x2.5 and so on (x5 at most). The series multiplies the fares (and with them the punctuality bonus), not the ticket sales; the game's trip summary says which course of the series it was and what the next pays, and the launcher's report says how much the series added. [ROLLBACK careerpay-1]
- Career Mode dealership: twice the offers - 6 buses for every size and class (were 3) and 3 for every model (were 2). [ROLLBACK careerpay-1]
- Bus thumbnails are taken faster: the next two buses of the queue are read (loaded and settled) in showrooms of their own while a picture is taken, instead of one after the other. [ROLLBACK thumbs-2]
- Ray tracing is locked for everybody (a test of whether it is what slows some installations down): the launcher's Graphics page no longer offers "Ray traced shadows (and occlusion)" and "Ray traced reflections", the game's menu neither, and the saved values, `graphics=enhanced_plus`, `--enhanced-plus` and `OMSI_ENHANCED_PLUS` are read as off. **Ctrl+Alt+R in the launcher** unlocks the options (`rt_unlocked=1` in `settings.cfg`; pressed again it locks them and turns ray tracing off). Locked, `settings.cfg` is written with `rt_shadows=0` and `rt_reflections=off`, so the choice has to be made again after unlocking. [ROLLBACK rtlock-1]

### Added
- The night sky [ROLLBACK nightsky-1]: stars, the Milky Way and the moon with its phases, in both pictures. **Stars** are the sky of the place and the hour: the 131 brightest stars with their true positions and colours (from their B-V index) and a few thousand fainter ones, made up on a grid over the sphere (denser along the Milky Way), all turning with the clock - the local sidereal time (`omsi-sim/src/night.rs`, `Daylight::sidereal_rad`) and the map's latitude turn the celestial sphere over the horizon, so the pole star stands a latitude high and stays put and Orion rises in the east in winter. The stars twinkle (more near the horizon), redden and dim in the long way through the air near it, and show only where the sky behind them is dark: a clear night shows the 6th magnitude, a hazy one, a city's glow or the glare of a full moon fewer, a twilight none; clouds and fog hide them. The **Milky Way** is a band of unresolved stars along the galactic equator, thicker and warmer towards the centre in Sagittarius, broken by dust lanes and grainy; the Andromeda galaxy and the two Magellanic Clouds are there for the dark skies. **The moon** is a lit sphere: its lit side faces the sun, so the phase is the real one and the crescent opens the right way; no limb darkening (a full moon is a flat disc), the dark side keeps a trace of earthshine; its face has the seas (Imbrium, Serenitatis, Tranquillitatis, Crisium, Procellarum and the others) and the ray craters (Tycho, Copernicus, Kepler, Aristarchus), turned as it is seen from the place (north up when it stands in the south, tilted when it rises); by day it is a pale disc in the blue. **The night's brightness follows the moon**: the Enhanced sky had its moonlight already (`illum^2.3`); the Vanilla picture's ambient and secondary light are now scaled by `night::night_light_gain` - a full moon high up more than doubles the stock night's light (x2.35), a night without a moon (new, or set) is a quarter darker (x0.75), a half moon in between, easing in with the twilight. Setting **"Night sky"** (launcher Graphics and the game's menu, `night_sky` in `settings.cfg`, 0 = off .. 2, 1 as designed; at 0 there are no stars and no moon and the night is as before). `omsi-render/src/stars.wgsl` (new, in the sky's shader source), `sky.wgsl` and `sky_enhanced.wgsl` (`vanilla_night`, `night_sky`), the camera uniform's new `night` and `moon` members (`CameraUniform`, `shader.wgsl`, `sky.wgsl`), `Lighting::{sidereal, night_sky}`, `omsi-app/src/lights.rs`, `app_events.rs`, the settings plumbing; tests in `night.rs` and `daylight.rs` (the sidereal time, a star on the meridian, the pole star, the shader's inverse, the moonlight and the night's gain).
- Glare round the sun and the moon (Enhanced) [ROLLBACK sunglare-1]: light scatters in the eye and lays a veil over everything round its source, in the picture or just outside it. A new pass (`glare.wgsl`, `GlareRes`) adds, before the glow takes the picture, the CIE glare equation - the veil's luminance is the source's illuminance times 10 / theta^3 (theta in degrees from the source, plus a small wide term), tinted by the sun's colour, so a low sun glares warm - for the sun and (weaker) the moon. **How much of the source is seen** decides its strength: 13 directions in a ring round the sun and the moon are looked up in the depth prepass (the sky is depth 0), the cloud over the source is read from the sky cube, and the result is smoothed over a few frames, so the sun going behind a tree or a building fades the glare instead of flicking it, and a source just outside the picture still glares. **Light shafts**: from each pixel a march of 24 steps towards the sun on the screen takes in the sky it passes (the depth prepass as the occluders), so a pixel behind a canopy or between buildings with a gap in the way of the sun is lit by what comes through - streaks of light through the trees. Setting **"Sun glare"** (launcher Graphics and the game's menu, `sun_glare`, 0 = off .. 2, 1 as designed); `OMSI_NO_GLARE=1` switches the pass off. Needs the depth prepass as a texture, so not on GL (like the SSAO), nor in the headset or in mirrors; Vanilla has none (it has no high-range picture to put it in).
- Career Mode, Choose offered buses [ROLLBACK careerignore-2]: the list lost the bus names when scrolled inside a manufacturer (the rows of a manufacturer whose header had scrolled out of sight were skipped with it); it is now one flat run of rows, each drawn when it touches the view. Each model is tinted (green offered, red hidden, amber for a catalogue row that covers several models of the files, only some of them offered) with a tag and a switch; the list can be narrowed to "All / Offered / Hidden" (a narrowed list opens every manufacturer) and read by "File names" (as the bus files write them, as before) or "Catalogue names" (the catalogue's corrected manufacturer and model; one row can cover several file models and switches all of them - the company still keeps the files' own keys). `Catalog::named_tree`; `omsi-app/src/launcher/career_ignore.rs` (the layout and the view filters have tests).
- Career Mode, menu: "Rules" and "Progress" are gone from the menu (the levels still show on the Overview); "Depots" and "Staff" are real pages now.
- Career Mode, depots [ROLLBACK careerdepot-1]: a company keeps its buses in depots. It starts with one (the home map, three parking places); a place costs 2 500 and 1 000 more for each one the depot has beyond three (20 at most), a new depot - on any installed map, named by the player - costs 15 000, 30 000, 50 000 ... (eight at most) and rent of 40 for every booked session on every depot beyond the first; an empty depot is sold back for half its price. The depot the player works from (changed for nothing on the Depots page) is where the dealer delivers - a full depot buys no bus - and which map the Jobs page reads; only its buses can go out. Moving a bus to another depot costs 300 (600 to another map) and needs a free place. The Depots page lists the depots, shows the chosen one's places as cards (the bus's picture in each place taken, "on a job" on those out), buys places and depots and renames. The Fleet page can list one depot or all and moves the selected bus; an older company gets a home depot with room for the buses it has. `company.rs` (`Depot`, `economy::depot_price`, `slot_price`, tests), `career_depot.rs`.
- Career Mode, staff [ROLLBACK careerstaff-1]: hire drivers (at most 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 by company level; applicants change every two days or for 60, and a better reputation draws better ones). A driver has a skill (grows with every job, a training course adds 3), traits (careful, reckless, punctual, often late, economical, heavy foot, dislikes / likes night shifts, fair-weather, steady in bad weather), a wage per course and a retainer for every session the player books. On the Jobs page "Send a driver" takes the same bus, line, tour and first course: the job is driven in the head (stops served, late, crashes, takings, fuel - from the skill, the traits, the bus's condition, the night and a weather rolled for the job), takes a few real minutes (90 s to a quarter of an hour) and is paid when its time is up, also when the launcher was closed meanwhile; the bus is out on the job meanwhile (it cannot be driven, sold or serviced). A job pays like the player's, with half the experience, less the wage. `staff.rs` (pure, tested), `company.rs`, `career_staff.rs`.
- Career Mode, Jobs: the chosen course is shown on a map (the Drive page's map picture, framed on the course's route, dragged and zoomed here too, the first and last stop written beside their points); the bar has "Drive myself / Send a driver"; the session report names the company's costs (depot rent, retainers). `career_jobs.rs`.
- Career Mode, debug window: "Finish driver jobs now" and "+1 place here (free)".
- Stand-in pictures for roller blinds and plug-in signs [ROLLBACK blindtex-1]: a bus with a roller blind shows the picture its depot file (`.hof`) names for the destination (a `[matl_freetex]` string such as `..\..\Anzeigen\Rollband_SD79\<name>.bmp`), and most maps do not bring those pictures, so the blind stayed blank. When the file is not there and the path lies in a blind's folder the game knows, the picture is drawn from the texts the depot file holds for that destination (found by the picture's name among the destination's strings, else the destination the bus shows now; the text is written exactly as the depot file has it, no change of case; without a depot file the picture's file name is the text), in a higher resolution than the originals, in Roboto condensed and bold: `Rollband_SD79` (also `Rollband_SD83`): black on white, the destination and a smaller second line, inside the field of the original (1024 x 256); `Rollband_O307*`: a paper band with the line number twice, a rule and the destination with its second line (1720 x 344), made again when the line changes; `Steckschild*`: a white plate (a guess, no original at hand). Text is fitted to the margins of the originals (a long destination is made smaller). Files that exist are used as before; other blinds (`Rollband_FC`...) are untouched. The log says what was drawn from which strings (`no picture, drawn as ...`). `omsi-sim/src/blindtex.rs`, the hook is in `sync_materials`.
- More stand-in blinds [ROLLBACK blindtex-2]: the pictures a map does not bring are now also drawn for `Rollband_Phantom` (white on near black over the whole picture, 1024 x 256), `Rollband_Mirage` (yellow-green capitals on near black with a visible margin, 2048 x 512), `PR110` (four cells of stencilled lettering on beige paper: line number, destination on two lines - a long one alone is split at a space - and a double arrow, 2048 x 608) and `Dykty_Juzek` (grey plates, four large and four small ones with the destination in one stencilled line, two blank rear ones, black elsewhere, 1996 x 614). The stencilled ones are set in Roboto bold, narrowed, with bridges cut in the round letters; the text is written as the depot file has it. The `Rollband_O307` picture's text is held in the original's fields by tests. `omsi-sim/src/blindtex.rs`.
- Stand-in blinds follow the destination, and a text of one line is set on two [ROLLBACK blindtex-3]: a destination typed by hand in the destination menu has no picture of its own, so the bus asks for the same file name whatever the text is (and the two places the menu alternates between share it), and the picture drawn for it stayed that of the first text; the picture is now kept under the destination shown (its row of the depot file, and the line for the pictures that carry it) as well as the name, so every new text makes a new picture. A text that comes as one line is also set on two where the picture is made for two: `PR110` always (a single word, or a short name with a one or two letter first word such as `U Ruhleben`, stays one line), the other blinds where one line would not fit at its size (the second line, set smaller, takes the larger share of the text). `omsi-sim/src/blindtex.rs`, `omsi-app/src/scene.rs`.
- Stand-in pictures for `Rollband_N40XX` and for plug-in signs [ROLLBACK blindtex-4]: `Rollband_N40*` is drawn in its three segments (774 x 64, drawn at four times that): the destination on two lines (a text of one line that does not fit the segment is split in two there), the whole destination on one line, and the line number last, in light green on grey-black as `Rollband_Mirage`. `Steckschild*` (a plug-in sign's picture, and so the pictures in a plug-in sign's own folder such as `Dykty_Juzek`) is now the real format: 256 x 64 drawn at four times that, light grey, the text in the top 35 rows (one line, black, the destination's lines joined; two small lines when one would have to be made smaller than two thirds), the line number at its left. `omsi-sim/src/blindtex.rs`.
- Stand-in pictures: suffixes and a larger line number on the O307 [ROLLBACK blindtex-5]: a depot file marks a variant of a destination with a `*` ("Weeze*B"); the picture drawn in place of a missing file now leaves out the `*` and what follows, line by line, for every blind and plug-in sign. The line number of `Rollband_O307*` is drawn a little larger (capitals 92 high where the original's are 85, within the original's field; a long number is narrowed before it is made smaller). `omsi-sim/src/blindtex.rs`.
- The bus catalogue comes with the game [ROLLBACK catalog-default-1]: the catalogue of the buses the game knows (their names in the game, manufacturers, variants, size, class, the years built, and which models Career Mode's dealership leaves out by default - 1 186 models, 279 game models) is compiled in (`crates/omsi-launcher-core/data/bus_catalog_default.json`, the file the catalogue editor exports) and is what a player starts with, in the Drive page, the AI list and Career Mode, until he has a catalogue of his own. A bus of a pack he does not have installed is simply never asked for (nothing is listed, hidden or needed for it), and a bus the catalogue has never heard of keeps the names its files give, as before. The player's own `bus_catalog.json` takes the place of it as soon as there is one and every edit is written to it; a file that cannot be read now leaves the catalogue that comes with the game in use (with the reason shown). In Settings > Bus catalogue two buttons put the game's catalogue back: "Game's list: add new" adds the entries the player's has none for (his own stay), "Game's list: restore" (pressed twice) replaces it all. `Catalog::builtin()` is the compiled-in one now and `Catalog::empty()` the empty one. `omsi-launcher-core/src/catalog.rs`, `omsi-app/src/launcher/career_catalog.rs`.
- Career Mode, dealership [ROLLBACK careerdeal-1]: two more ways to sort the offers, "Newest first" and "Oldest first" (by the year the bus was built; a bus of an unknown year last, then the least worn first). The SD200 and the SD202 (found in the model, variant, name or file of a bus, in any spelling) are rare in the stock: they come in dozens of files, so all of those of one size and class together are drawn as often as half an ordinary bus (`CLUTTER_SHARE` in `company.rs`), about one lot in four has one at all; a category that has nothing else still offers them. The rest is drawn as before.
- Career Mode, Customize > Paint [ROLLBACK paintmix-1]: besides stickers and objects the editor has a Paint tab for the bus of the fleet: another repaint as a whole (its pictures and its settings), the pictures of another repaint on the settings the bus keeps ("Pictures only": nothing of the bus's configuration changes, the repaint's `[setvar]` lines are not applied), and any single `[CTCTexture]` slot (a stripe, a destination display) taken from any repaint. The bus in the picture follows at once; "Save and close" keeps the paint with the bus (in the company's file; the thumbnails, the jobs and the game use it). Such a mix is written in the paint's name (`Red||tex=Blue||slot:Stripe=Green`, see `omsi-sim/src/paint_mix.rs`) and made into one more paint scheme of the bus when it is loaded (also for the rear sections of an articulated bus), so everything that already passes a paint along carries it.
- Fogged and frosted windows (to be judged): the player's bus fogs its windows from the inside when the air of the cabin is humid for the glass's temperature (a full bus on a cold or rainy day; a moving bus more than a standing one), frosts them on the outside on a humid night under freezing and ices the steam inside on a pane under freezing. They are drawn in the layer of the rain (a bus's `[alphascale] Rain_Window_…` film), under the drops, so only the windows have any (a bus without such a layer has none, and none while it snows, when the film is the snow crystals' picture) - and the film is now kept on a dry day while there is ice on it. Frost: feathers (a stem with barbs a few millimetres apart) grown from sites about 5 and 11 cm apart that lengthen with the level, meet and fill with a thin white sheet, thick ice scattering white and bending what is seen through it by the slope of its ridges, blurred where thick. Condensation: a haze of droplets that blurs and whitens, thicker low on the pane and in patches, beads a few millimetres across (each a lens) and clear runs with a bead at their end. Everything is laid out in true metres over the pane (the texture's scale to a quarter of an octave) and band-limited by the size of a pixel on the glass, so fine structure fades into its average instead of shimmering. The picture behind the glass is now prepared also when there is ice, rain or none. The levels follow the bus's own cabin air (`Cabinair_Temp`, `Cabinair_relHum`, the engine's stand-in otherwise) and the weather's temperature and humidity: steam builds in a minute or two, frost in several, and a bus that stood out all night starts frosted. In cold air an exhaust's vapour (the `auspuff_*` smoke of the buses) shows white, thicker and a little bigger. **Ctrl+Shift+F** previews the effects whatever the weather (fog 100 / 50 %, frost 100 / 50 %, cold exhaust, all of them, and back to the weather's own); `OMSI_FX_PREVIEW=n` starts in one of them. [ROLLBACK glassfx-1, glassfx-2, glassfx-3]
- Fogged and frosted windows, second round [ROLLBACK glassfx-3]: the glass has a temperature of its own that follows the air in a few minutes, and every session (or bus) starts as if it had stood out all night - the glass at the outside temperature, so a cold day starts with its frost and the cabin's heat melts it, instead of the frost being worked out from a cabin the bus's script starts warm (and the state no longer carries over from the previous session). A bus's defroster / demister switch, found by name (`defrost`, `demist`, `defog`, `entfrost`, `entnebel`; logged at the start), blows the glass warm sooner. Frost sets in on humid air from 60 % (it wanted 80 %). The crystals are a quarter smaller. The ice stays on a door that is opened (it was judged by the bus's box, which an open door leaves) and is drawn over the drops from the cab, under them from outside (the steam is on the inner face, the rain on the outer).
- Fogged and frosted windows are switched off for now [ROLLBACK glassfx-4]: nothing is drawn or copied for them unless the game is started with `OMSI_GLASS_ICE=1` (Ctrl+Shift+F then previews them again). The cold exhaust's vapour stays on.
- Draw order of see-through surfaces [ROLLBACK draworder-1]: every instance gets a creation number (`draw_order`) and blended meshes at the same distance are sorted by it instead of by the slot the instance happens to sit in. A freed slot is reused for the newest instance (AI vehicles, streamed tiles), so the slot order stopped being the order the models were made in, and layers of one model (glass over dirt over a rain film over a display) could be drawn the wrong way round after a while. The same creation number keeps the order stable when instances come and go. A GPU test (`--ignored`) covers a recycled slot.
- Alpha in mip levels [ROLLBACK alphamip-1]: pictures with a real alpha (glass, decals, grids, foliage, corona and smoke sprites) are halved weighted by alpha, in linear light, so the see-through texels (black or whatever the brush left) no longer dim the visible colour at every level, which showed as dark outlines and thin, dirty-looking distant glass. Opaque pictures, masks that are entirely clear in a block, bump maps and data textures are unchanged. Affects the compressed mip chains made at load (`encode_levels`), the half-size stand-in (`halved_for_now`), `fit_texture` (textures over the chip's limit) and the CPU mips of corona/smoke textures.
- Vehicles drawn in model order keep the depth of their clear texels [ROLLBACK blendcut-142]: the shader's cut of fully transparent texels of depth-writing blended slots (blendcut-140, aimed at stickers and text planes of scenery) is no longer applied to a vehicle drawn in model order (`Instance::ordered`). Omsi.exe writes the depth of a `[matl_alpha] 2` slot whatever its alpha, and content uses invisible boxes and planes as masks: the box over the Mercedes' roller blind housing hides the blind, the plane over the Neoplan's knob housings cuts them out of the flap. The cut took the masks out (0.4.0 had none of it and drew them right), and the depth prepass of such vehicles, which career23 had started to fill in, laid the depth of what the model lists after a mask in front of it; the prepass is left out for them as in 0.4.0 again (`OMSI_ORDERED_PREPASS=1`: in the prepass). Scenery keeps the cut.
- Desktop builds allocate through mimalloc [ROLLBACK alloc-1] (`omsi-app`'s `main.rs`, the `mimalloc` dependency in `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock`; a phone keeps its own allocator): fewer stalls where the render, simulation and loader threads all allocate at once. Not measured here; to take it out, delete the `#[global_allocator]` item and the dependency. The release scripts build with `--locked`, so `Cargo.lock` must come along with `Cargo.toml`.
- Solid blended bodies first [ROLLBACK blendmask-1]: in scenery (not vehicles, not ground), a slot blended by `[matl_alpha] 2` whose texture is opaque over three in four of its faces (a wall declared blended for its few windows) is drawn before the thin blended layers around it - a shadow, a sticker, a text plane. Drawn after them, the wall failed the depth test against the depth those layers had written over their soft texels, and the building showed an x-ray through its side in the shape of the shadow or the letters. `OMSI_NO_SOLID_FIRST=1`: as before.
- Customize screen, objects: besides stickers, small 3D objects (a can, a poster, a ticket holder...) can be put anywhere on a bus, outside or - from the interior view - inside. An object is an asset: a folder of its own in the new `Assets` folder next to the launcher, holding a `.asset` file written like a `model.cfg` (`[mesh]`, `[matl]`, `[matl_alpha]`, `[matl_noZwrite]`, `[matl_envmap]`... plus `[name]`, `[author]`, `[description]`), the model (`.o3d` or `.x`) and its textures side by side. Drop a folder or a zip with a `.asset` file onto the launcher to install it (see `ASSETS.md`). A selected object has a gizmo in the picture - arrows to move it and rings to turn it, along its own axes or the bus's - and buttons for exact steps, and a scale. Objects are kept in the same sets as stickers (per bus, per model, presets), belong to the mesh they were put on (so an object on a door moves with the door) and are left out, without harm, when the asset is not installed. An object is put down as modelled ("On the surface" stands it on the surface). The wheel pressed in moves the camera sideways and up; W, A, S, D fly it forward, back and to the sides, Q and E down and up. [ROLLBACK assets-1]
- Customize screen: the editor has two modes, "Customize decals" and "Customize objects", switched freely (each lists and edits only its own kind). "Choose an object…" opens a browser over the picture with a tile for every installed asset - a rendered picture of the model, its name and author - and the description beside a larger picture of the chosen one. The wheel now changes the camera's field of view (also a slider in the panel) instead of moving it; W, A, S, D still fly. New second camera, "Free flight": drag looks around, pressed wheel slides, W A S D Q E fly (Shift faster) and nothing stops it - it goes through the bus and the ground. The View buttons return to the orbit camera. [ROLLBACK assets-2]
- Customize screen, stickers: a "0°" button next to the turn slider; the size is set by width or by height (both sliders, in centimetres, the proportions kept) and by exact one-centimetre buttons (wider, narrower, taller, shorter). [ROLLBACK decals-size]
- Textures, vehicles and the budget (texmem-1): [ROLLBACK texmem-1] the AI traffic's vehicle sets (every type in up to four paints) were uploaded ahead and kept on the GPU for good, and the vehicles' textures are never shrunk: on a small budget they left the scenery too little and it was shrunk and brought back all the time. Now, once the vehicles' textures take more than 30 % of the budget, the paints are no longer all uploaded ahead (the first paint of every type goes first; a paint nobody wears is uploaded when a car first has it) and the sets no car wears are let go after 90 s, as the timetable's are. A texture is shrunk only beyond 210 m (it is brought back within 150 m: no more shrinking the second after), and the copies of a second go to the GPU in one submission instead of one for each texture. The automatic budget of a card that is known to hold 1.6 GB is no longer taken below that by a small system memory (an eighth of 8 GB). With `OMSI_PROFILE=1` the budget line also says how much of it the vehicles take.
- Career Mode, the decal editor (Fleet > Customize; simple stickers only, not a full repaint tool), a first version: the bus is shown
  large; a new sticker follows the cursor over the bus, seen on the body as it goes, until you click; the camera can look from the front, back or a side and zoom in on the cursor; texts can use any font of the system; an imported picture can be cut down to a size; "Reset to the original paint" removes all stickers. Stickers can go on windows ("On a window") and, from the interior view, on the inside of the bus. In the launcher's bus picture the pressed wheel moves the camera (W, A, S, D, Q, E fly it) and the wheel zooms the whole view. A sticker is a typed text (bold, italic,
  colour, several lines) or a picture of yours (imported into `decals/images` in the data
  folder), with a size in metres, a turn and a mirror. The sticker is not painted into any
  texture: the part of the body under it is copied as a thin extra mesh with the sticker's
  picture, so it works over every repaint, never touches a mod's files, keeps its real size
  and moves with a door it sits on. A set is kept for one bus or for every bus of the model
  (`decals/bus_<id>.json`, `decals/model_<model>.json`), plus named presets of a model; the
  game puts the saved stickers on the player's bus when it starts. Stickers on windows
  show from both sides; doors (and other big clickable parts) take stickers; tyres, small
  switches and displays take none. A sticker no longer drawn as glass when its host mesh is
  named like a window. [ROLLBACK decals-1]
- Career Mode, the second page of the launcher: found a bus company on a map of your choice
  (in the currency you choose, at fixed rates), say which models the dealership leaves out
  (by the names the bus files give), buy buses from the dealership (a few of every size and
  class among the installed buses, new or used, each built in a year of its model's years and
  in a random paint of its own list other than the bus's default), keep them in a fleet
  (service, livery editor to come, fleet number and plate, selling), a ledger, company levels. Jobs,
  licences and staff are described on their pages and come next. The company is
  `career/slot0.json` in the data folder; Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Backspace opens a debug window
  (money, level, reputation, currency, resets). [ROLLBACK career-148]
- A bus catalogue (`bus_catalog.json` in the data folder; Settings > Bus catalogue, or
  Career Mode > Catalog): you say, for each model in the bus files, which manufacturer and
  model it is in the game (a pack's "manufacturer" may be the pack's name), which model each model name in the files is and the
  rest of the name as its variant (engine, gearbox ...), each model's size (MINI, MIDI, MAXI,
  MEGA), class (City, Intercity, Long-distance, Double-decker, Minibus) and years built, and
  whether Career Mode leaves it out by default. It can be exported, replaced from a file, or
  have only the new entries of a file added. [ROLLBACK career-148]
- Cached bus pictures (`cache/bus_thumbs/`), taken once by the showroom's renderer in a
  photo-studio light (the sun behind the camera, the bus filling the picture), for lists of
  buses. [ROLLBACK career-148]
- Career Mode, Jobs: pick a bus of the fleet, a line, a tour and the first course of the
  home map's timetable and start the session. The game (`--career <file>`) asks after every
  course whether to drive the next one or to go back to the garage, reports the courses
  into the session file, and when it closes the launcher pays them (fares by kilometres and
  stops served, a punctuality bonus, crashes cost money), adds the kilometres, wear and
  experience, and shows a report. [ROLLBACK career-149]
- Career Mode economy: a course pays for the stops served and the kilometres (a city course of
  6 km and 11 stops about 70 euros), the difficulty multiplies fares (x1.4 / x1 / x0.6) and
  costs; tickets sold in the game are added as they are. Fuel: the tank level is kept per bus
  (the game starts the bus with it and reports it back), fuel filled up in the game is paid
  for, the Fleet page refuels at the depot and shows the consumption. Inspection every 21
  days driven (below 50 % condition the bus may fail and stays in the yard until repaired),
  repairs, a bank loan (limit by company level, interest per session, a share of the fares
  repays it), a manufacturer filter in the dealership. No licences: the Licenses page is now
  the company's rules. [ROLLBACK career-150]
- Dealership: buses are priced and driven by their year (a bus of 2008 in 2026: about a
  million kilometres, a few thousand euros); a model no longer built cannot be bought new;
  cards show the manufacturer, the model in large type, the description below, the year and
  kilometres larger. The bus catalogue has Copy years / Paste years. The pictures are
  centred: the studio measures the real bus against the empty room. [ROLLBACK career-149]

### Fixed
- The game menu's Time page sets the date too: a "Date" row to type it (2026-10-14, 14.10.2026
  or 20261014, Enter) and an "Adjust date" row with -1/+1 day, month and year (a day kept
  within the month it lands in, the year rolling over). Off while the real-time sync is on and
  for a LAN client. [ROLLBACK date-147]
- The AI-train changes of 144 to 146 (rail heading, `back_track`, the diagnostic log) are taken
  out again: they did not help. [ROLLBACK train-147]
- A click on a scenery object's `[mouseevent]` in the map camera (F4) is that object's, no
  longer the "move the vehicle here?" question. [ROLLBACK f4click-142]
- The cars of an AI train behind the end of the track it had recorded (just started, or
  started afresh after a jump) were all put on the trail's oldest point, one inside the
  other; they follow the way again. [ROLLBACK trail-142]
- Foliage whose material has a black diffuse colour (the leaf cards of some bushes) came out
  black in the Enhanced picture: Direct3D lights such a card by the ambient colour, so the
  texture shows; it does now. [ROLLBACK leafcolour-141]
- A scenery mesh's blended body (a wall with a transmap) is drawn before the blended layers
  lying on it (a logo with its soft shadow), so that those layers no longer leave holes in
  it where they are partly transparent. [ROLLBACK cutbody-141]
- Tram improvements (Marceli Franczyk): both bogies of a rail vehicle on the track, the
  right one of two parallel tracks, a whole `[couple_back]` chain (eleven parts of the NF6D),
  joints from the model where the declared ones are wild, and scenery objects with a
  `[mouseevent]` answer click, drag, release and the wheel.
- Flat leaf cards of trees and bushes (a mesh plane on both sides) that came out entirely
  black: the back copy's normals point down, which gave it the ground's ambient light and
  pushed its shadow lookup into the card itself. A foliage normal that points down is now
  turned up, in the Vanilla and Enhanced pictures alike. [ROLLBACK foliage-140]
- A small plane with an alpha texture (a sticker on a building, a text-texture plane) cut a
  hole of its own shape into the meshes drawn after it behind it: its fully transparent
  texels were written into the depth buffer. Fully transparent texels of depth-writing
  blended layers are now not drawn at all (not on the ground's own layers).
  [ROLLBACK blendcut-140]
- **Game menu on foot**: "Vehicle options..." is no line of the Esc menu while the player walks about outside a vehicle.
- **AI buses**: a bus with its engine off (the end of its line, a long wait) no longer blows exhaust smoke.
- **AI traffic, right of way**: a car out of a side road that had decided to go, or was in the junction already, went on whatever came along the main road, and across the second lane of the main road in a left turn it never looked at all. It now stops short of a meeting place with a moving vehicle that has the right of way and would be there before it is clear, where it still can. Cars are also seen coming from further off at speed (eight seconds of their way instead of a hundred metres): at 70 km/h a car on the main road was seen five seconds away, less than the gap a side road's driver takes.
- **Rain on windows**: the drops of a window on the far side of a bus showed through its body. The vehicles drawn in model order are not in the depth prepass the rain films are tested against, and with multisampling (or puddles, which come with rain) the main pass keeps a depth of its own, so nothing hid the films behind them. Before the films are drawn the opaque depth of those vehicles is now laid on that depth.
- **Tools window**: on the Actions page, "Put an AI car on a street": every click in the game on a street then puts a car of the random traffic on the nearest lane there (Escape ends it), to follow how it drives on from a place of one's own choosing. A click where another vehicle stands, or away from any street, says why it did nothing.
- **AI buses**: a timetable bus no longer stands at every stop until twenty seconds before its departure time: it waits for the time only where the timetable says so (`[profile_otherstopping]` 3 and 4, "always + wait for departure time"), at the first stop of its trip (layover) and, a train, at its stations; at any other stop it leaves when the people are off and on, early or not. A bus that is more than two minutes early stops without anybody wanting it only at such a stop.
- **AI traffic**: cars that stood on the spot with their wheels turning, the way on and the lane changing every frame: two short lanes (paths of no length at a junction's edge) led into each other in a loop. The ways that lead back round such a loop, or back onto the lane the car came from, are left out of the choice of the way on (the car still takes any other way; where there is none it drives to the end of the paths and is gone, as in OMSI), and a car that passes to another lane twelve frames running is taken off the road (and said so in the log).
- **AI traffic**: a car that chooses its way on again while it stays on the same lane (a car that cannot make up its mind which way to go) says so in the log, up to six times for each car, with the lane, the old and the new choice - for tracing the cars that stand with their indicators flashing.
- **AI traffic, lights**: a car standing in a queue within three metres of the stop line when the green ended no longer counts as one that "went through on green" - those cars drove through the red that followed; the cars plan twenty lanes ahead (was ten), so that a light beyond many short road pieces is seen in time.
- **AI traffic, right of way**: a car that gave way no longer goes in front of one with the right of way that has only just stopped or is about to move off (it goes after a car that has stood for four seconds).
- **AI traffic, stuck cars**: a car whose wheels turn in one place (its odometer runs, the body does not) counts as standing now, so the usual clean-up reaches it; after twelve minutes without moving a car (a bus too) goes on without waiting for the right of way, a merge or the keeping back (not for a light, a person or a car ahead), and says so in the log; a bus whose doors stay open for more than two minutes after its departure time closes them.
- **AI traffic, indicators**: the indicator of a car does not flash left and right in turns (it holds a side for a second and a half) and a car standing still does not indicate a move sideways.
- **AI buses**: a bus that has finished its trip stops the engine at the end of the line after twenty seconds, as one placed there already did.
- **Graphics**: V-sync is off by default now, and a settings file from an older version gets it off once (turn it on again in Options > Graphics and it stays); with it on, many players waited for the screen at half or a third of its refresh rate.
- **Texture memory**: the list offers 8, 12, 16 and 24 GB where the graphics card holds them (it stopped at 6 GB, also on a 24 GB card); the automatic budget is 4 GB on cards with 10 GB or more (it was 2.5 GB everywhere), and the launcher's "Automatic (... here)" shows the figure the game really takes.
- **Interface**: the windows of the game menu and its lists, their side panels, the timetable, the tutorial page and the editor panel are see-through as the Alt menu is (about 84 %, thinner or thicker with the interface opacity setting); the colours are unchanged. The game menu has no "Camera..." line (it is a page of Options; in the cabin "Driver view and mirrors..." is there).
- **World options, Time**: the rows are plain "Time", "Hour" and "Minute" (no hints in brackets).
- **Game menu (Esc)**: the line "Controls..." is gone; the Options page Controls has "Keyboard" and "Game controllers" in its place (and the way back from them leads there).
- **Alt menu**: "Teleport to a start point" is greyed out while walking about (it moves the vehicle at the wheel).
- **Getting up**: the setting "Ability to get up" is gone - it is always possible - and the key is in the key list (`Get up from the driver's seat`, Ctrl+Shift+G by default) to be moved.
- **Game menu (Esc)**: "Line and tour...", "World options...", "Save to a new slot" and "Screenshot" are gone; "Save the situation" / "Load the quicksave" are "Quick Save" / "Quick Load"; "City map" shows only when the HUD has no navigator tile; new lines: "Walk out" (at the wheel, next to "Back to my bus" on foot), "Clear AI traffic", and in the cabin "Driver view and mirrors...".
- **World options**: the pages Tools and Traffic and people are gone; Weather and Temperature and wind are one page, the METAR has its own; the pages have lower rows and a taller window so that they hardly scroll. Time: a large clock to click and type (`12`, `12:30`, `9:05:07`, `930` all work), Morning / Noon / Evening / Night side by side (morning and evening at the sun's rise and set at the map's place, noon 12:00, night 00:00), +/-1 hour, minute and second buttons (the sliders stay), the real-time sync at the foot; the time speed slider is gone.
- **Passengers (regression of 122)**: someone waiting at a stop is now drawn only from the destinations a bus leaves for in the next 20 minutes - there is no more falling back to all of them (that waited for a trip half a day away), and the stop itself is never a destination. Nobody gets off at the stop they got on at before the bus has moved (30 m).
- **"Teleport to a start point"** (Alt menu): the list is alphabetical (digits by value).
- Alt menu (takeover-123): [ROLLBACK takeover-123] the extra "Drive another vehicle" tile is gone; the old "Swap for another vehicle" tile now opens the list of vehicles standing in the world (placed or left ones, nearest first) and takes the wheel of the one chosen. (Esc, Vehicles still has "Swap" in the driven vehicle's place.)
- The bus "fell through the ground" and was put back at another vehicle (safepose-123): [ROLLBACK safepose-123] the place the bus last stood was kept whatever happened; after a jump to an entry point, the map or another vehicle (tiles still to be read, no ground yet) the bus was taken for fallen and put back at that old place - beside the other vehicle. A pose farther than 150 m from the bus is dropped; a bus really under the ground with no pose of its own is put on the ground where it is.
- Timetable tile of the Alt menu in free roam (schedlist-123): [ROLLBACK schedlist-123] reading the timetable for the lists of lines and tours loaded the models of every depot vehicle and train of the map (15-30 s in the frame of the click). A game with no timetable buses now reads only the timetable.
- Interior sounds of each section (intsep-122): [ROLLBACK intsep-122] a new tag `[int_sounds_separate]` in a `.bus` (or the `.ovh` of a rear section) keeps the interior sounds of the sections of an articulated bus apart. In a section only its own interior sounds are heard; of the other sections only the outside entries, through the bodywork (volume by `Snd_OutsideVol`, the cab's low-pass). The camera decides which section you are in. Documented in docs/MODDING.md.
- Drive another vehicle (takeover-122): [ROLLBACK takeover-122] the Alt menu (and Esc, Vehicles) has a "Drive another vehicle" list of the vehicles standing in the world - those you placed or left, nearest first, with the distance; on foot your own is on it too. Chosen, you take its wheel. Placed vehicles are also kept clear of parked cars that come back with their tile (every two seconds, within a kilometre of the camera), and are written to saved situations as before.
- Zoom keys (zoomkeys-122): [ROLLBACK zoomkeys-122] = / - and the numpad's + / - no longer zoom the view; the keys "Zoom the view in / out (hold)" are on the Controls page, unassigned by default.
- The "End of the trip. Next: ... (it starts by itself a minute before)" line is gone (tip-122): [ROLLBACK tip-122].
- Game controllers in the log (ctrllog-122): [ROLLBACK ctrllog-122] "game controllers found: ..." is written when the list changes, not at every scan.
- Passengers and the stops' exit numbers (paxweight-122): [ROLLBACK paxweight-122] the weight of a destination is the exit number of the stop object it names, found by its label or by its name in the timetable (it fell back to 0.5 when the two differed, so a technical stop with 0 was chosen like any other). A destination of weight 0 is never drawn, a draw never ends without a destination at a stop that has a line record (such people boarded the first bus listed, whatever it showed), and a stop whose destinations all take 0 has nobody waiting.
- Cab sounds quieter after the start (introvol-122): [ROLLBACK introvol-122] a sound entry that is not playing starts with a buffer at 0 dB again, so a volume over 0 dB, which DirectSound refuses, no longer stays at a stale low value from the moment before until the camera is switched F1-F3-F1.
- Passengers have a weight (payload-121): [ROLLBACK payload-121] every person aboard the player's bus weighs what his `.hum` says (`[mass]`, 75 kg where it says none); the front section's body takes it into its mass, centre of gravity, inertia, body frequency and the static load of its wheels, a rear section or trailer adds it to the mass the front body tows and to its wheel load. A full bus is felt in acceleration, braking and in the springs; before, the passengers weighed nothing.
- Developer tools (payload-121): [ROLLBACK payload-121] a new Actions page holds the reload buttons (moved from the Variables page) and three buttons for made-up passengers (all free standing places, all free seats, remove them again); under the overlays the weight of the vehicle itself, of its passengers and the real one.
- Traced reflections on the coupled sections (rtparts-120): [ROLLBACK rtparts-120] with "Ray traced reflections: player's vehicle" the second and third section of an articulated bus (and a trailer) are traced like the first (the test was the first section's box alone; the camera uniform now carries the coupled sections' boxes, `puddle_parts`, and enhanced.wgsl asks `near_player_train`).
- Vehicle descriptions still cut (index-120): [ROLLBACK index-120] the launcher's catalog cache kept the descriptions cut at 600 characters by older builds (its stamps cover folders, not the code); its version is raised, so the vehicle list is read again once.
- Start points sorted (entries-120): [ROLLBACK entries-120] the "Start at" lists (Drive page and phone layout) are alphabetical, numbers by value; the choice is still the entry's place in `global.cfg`'s list.
- Launcher menu (tabs-119): [ROLLBACK tabs-119] the Profile button is gone (the player card at the bottom left opens the same page); the Mods and Timetable tabs are hidden until "Show the Mods tab" / "Show the Timetable tab" is switched on in Settings (`show_mods_tab`, `show_timetable_tab`); a hidden tab still shows while it is the open page.
- Showroom camera (showroom-119): [ROLLBACK showroom-119] the orbit camera fits the whole vehicle, or the whole group with its trailers, from every angle (a bounding sphere of length, width and height) so its front is no longer cut off when it turns.
- Launcher (launcher-119): [ROLLBACK launcher-119] choosing a bus picks a random livery (the default among them) instead of always the default; vehicle descriptions are read whole (limit 600 -> 6000 characters, brackets inside the text no longer end it, UTF-8 and UTF-16 files are decoded).
- Dev tool (gfx-119): [ROLLBACK gfx-119] four pages: Variables, Overlays (the picture overlays, moved from the first page), Mirror editor, AI debug; (120: the graphics-mode buttons tried here were taken out again).
- Vanilla spotlights (vanlights-119): [ROLLBACK vanlights-119] a vehicle's headlights are 2.5 times stronger in the Vanilla and Vanilla+ pictures (`VANILLA_HEADLIGHT_INTENSITY` 0.2 -> 0.5); Enhanced is untouched.
- Vanilla and Vanilla+ blend as Direct3D 9 does (gammablend-118, a friend's patch): [ROLLBACK gammablend-118] the classic pass (not Enhanced, not the puddle-reflection frames) shades to the encoded (sRGB) values and draws into a non-sRGB view of the sRGB picture, so transparent layers, glass, shadow blobs, coronas, smoke and the sky's fog mix on gamma-encoded values as in OMSI (`ENCODE_OUTPUT`, `finish_output` in colour.wgsl; `pass_classic`, `gamma_blend` in lib.rs). Not on OpenGL; Vanilla+ takes the same look. Costs a second set of classic pipelines and one intermediate picture a frame.
- Passenger paths of articulated buses (pathid-117): [ROLLBACK pathid-117] the sections' passenger paths are joined only where a cabin names its joint (`[linkToNextVeh]` / `[linkToPrevVeh]`): with both left out the sections stay apart (before: the cabin was joined at the aisle's ends all the same, so the link was still there and in the developer tools' picture); `OMSI_PAX_GUESS_LINK=1`: as before. The developer tools show each path point's number as its section's own `paths.cfg` has it (not counted from the front of the train), draw each section's paths and points in a colour of its own (a link between sections in white), and the labels keep their doors, joints and devices (humans.rs `point_section`/`point_local`, devtools_proc.rs `section_colour`).
- Traced reflections under blended layers (cover-115): [ROLLBACK cover-115] in a ray tracing frame a blended layer now covers the traced reflection of the layer under it as far as it is there, as it covers its colour (the alpha the layer writes into the reflection buffer is its coverage, the reflection's weight is the length of the vector there: `rt_cover` in enhanced.wgsl, rt_reflect.wgsl). A layer with no envmap - the copy of a reflecting layer, a second material on a black base, a rain film - no longer leaves the reflection of the layer under it standing on it, and two reflecting layers on top of each other no longer add their weights.
- Vehicles drawn in model order and the depth prepass (ordered-115): [ROLLBACK ordered-115] a vehicle drawn in the order of its model (see `Instance::ordered`) is left out of the depth prepass, whose depth of the later slots rejected what the model draws before them: a knob drawn first, its housing's alpha layer that cuts the ceiling panel's depth after it, then the panel - the cut showed the sky where the knob should stand. Ambient occlusion no longer sees such a vehicle's own surfaces. `OMSI_ORDERED_PREPASS=1`: as before.
- Sharp reflections on black and clear surfaces (sharp-114): [ROLLBACK sharp-114] the traced reflection (and the probe's blur) is spread by a surface's gloss only where its texture is coloured: black paint, clear panes and the black stripes of a pane mirror as sharply as glass, so the inside of a cab and the panes outside no longer look steamed up (enhanced.wgsl `refl_rough`). The painted part of a pane now also takes the soft sun shadow and the ambient occlusion that paint does (`painted`), so black on a window and black on the body match.
- Glass/paint classification and headlamp pool (reflect-113, headlamp-113): [ROLLBACK reflect-113] the painted part of a glass-class material (envmap + `matl alpha 2`) is now shaded and reflects exactly like envmapped paint - same base shading (lamps, AO, emissive), same F0/roughness/reflection weight - so black on the window no longer differs from black on the body (enhanced.wgsl `painted`); only the texture-colour logic decides how strong the reflection is. [ROLLBACK headlamp-113] `headlamp_shoulder` works in post-metering units (exposure gain included) and `HEADLAMP_KNEE`/`HEADLAMP_PEAK` are 0.15/0.50, so the headlamp pool on the road is no longer burnt white.
- Night reflections and headlamp light (rtspot-112, headlamp-112): [ROLLBACK rtspot-112] the ray-traced reflections no longer take in what the spot lights light: the twelve spot lights nearest the camera (vehicles' headlamps, beam cookies too) are passed to the reflection pass (`Params::spots`, rt.rs; `RtParams::spots`), and a ray that lands on a part of the picture inside such a lamp's cone and range sees it at `RT_SPOT_KEEP` (0.12) of its brightness, as the sky darkens (rt_reflect.wgsl `spot_lit`, `night_amount`) - the pool of the headlamps on the road is gone from the paint. `RT_SPOT_KEEP` 1.0: as before. [ROLLBACK headlamp-112] what the headlamps (spots and beam cookies) light is summed apart and brought down to a peak, as it lands on the picture: unchanged up to `HEADLAMP_KNEE` (0.45), then smoothly towards `HEADLAMP_PEAK` (1.1) and no further, the colour kept (enhanced.wgsl `headlamp_shoulder`), so the road close in front of a car no longer burns out however the lamp is set; `HEADLAMP_PEAK` 1.0e6: as before.
- Reflections, headlamps, route-arrow text (reflect-111, headlamp-111, helparrow-111): [ROLLBACK reflect-111] how much a surface reflects now depends on its colour: a light or coloured texture (a body's paint, a stripe painted on a pane) keeps `REFL_COLOURED` (0.35) of the reflection that a black one has, between `REFL_DARK_LUM` and `REFL_LIGHT_LUM`; clear glass keeps its own; the opaque part of a pane's texture (alpha over `REFL_PAINT_ALPHA`) is paint, with the paint's gloss (`REFL_PAINT_ROUGH`), so a pane painted black (`[matl_alpha] 2`) looks as the same black on an opaque material does. Applies to the probe's reflection and the ray-traced one alike (it lowers the surface's F0). `REFL_COLOURED` 1.0: as before. [ROLLBACK headlamp-111] the headlamps' highlight is softer still (`HEADLAMP_ALPHA_MIN` 0.45, `HEADLAMP_SPREAD` 0.015, `HEADLAMP_SPEC_CAP` 0.20) and the edge of a spot's cone grows softer with the distance from the lamp (`HEADLAMP_EDGE_SPREAD` 0.002 per metre, at most 0.08 in cosine). [ROLLBACK helparrow-111] the text of a route arrow (`[texttexture]`) is full bright too (an unlit material with a key of its own), so it no longer blooms.
- Night lighting, route arrows (headlamp-110, helparrow-110): [ROLLBACK headlamp-110] a vehicle's headlamps (spot or beam cookie) no longer burn out the road, grass and kerbs seen from in front of them: their highlight's lobe is at least as broad as `HEADLAMP_ALPHA_MIN` (0.30), widens by `HEADLAMP_SPREAD` (0.010 per metre) the farther the lit point is from the lamp, and is capped at `HEADLAMP_SPEC_CAP` (0.45) - constants at the top of the lamp code in enhanced.wgsl; seen along the beam nothing changes (the diffuse light is not touched). With ray-traced reflections the brightest a reflected ray may be falls to `RT_NIGHT_CAP` (0.35, rt_reflect.wgsl) of what it was as the sky darkens, so the lit patch of road no longer shows burned on the bodywork in front of the lamps. [ROLLBACK helparrow-110] a `[helparrow]` object is drawn as an unlit surface at its diffuse plus emissive colour (full bright by day and by night as in Omsi.exe, like a display) instead of as a light: its emissive colour no longer burns over the exposure and blooms into the glow.
- Route arrows with a script (helparrow-109): [ROLLBACK helparrow-109] a `[helparrow]` object that has a script (a map's own route arrow with a custom .sco) stayed visible when the route arrows were off: its script switched its meshes on again every frame over the hiding of `World::show_help_arrows`. Its meshes now follow the script only while the route arrows are on.
- AI traffic, corridor gaps, bus pairs and lane changes (lanes-108, bus-108, lanechange-108): [ROLLBACK lanes-108] on an object road the strip between two lanes (flat, no kerb or drop) now counts as road, not "no asphalt". [ROLLBACK bus-108] a timetable bus queueing behind another bus or the player's vehicle at its stop comes up to about half its minimum gap (at least 0.8 m); a bus with another one behind it for the same stop pulls on 2.5 m past its stop point to leave room in the bay. [ROLLBACK lanechange-108] a car that changes lane on its own (overtaking, keeping right, turn lanes) signals for two seconds before it moves (was 1.2), moves over along a longer, gentler path (3 to 4 s), and while it only signals the cars of the new lane hold it only when closer than 6 m: braking for a car 20 m ahead there stopped a plain lane change on a straight road for no reason. A bypass round a standing vehicle keeps its old 1.2 s.
- AI traffic, lanes beside on object roads (lanes-107): [ROLLBACK lanes-107] on a road laid out as objects the ground beside a car's path counted as "no road" even where another lane of the same road ran alongside (nothing links the lanes of objects to each other, and the ground has no asphalt there). The corridor now looks up the street lanes running alongside (`Net::lanes_beside`) and takes the width of each as road, so a car sees the lane next to it and can pull over onto it; kerbs and drops still count first.
- AI traffic, objects and wide roads (object-107, lane-107, bus-107): [ROLLBACK object-107] on a road laid out as objects the cars saw asphalt only along their own path and refused what lay beside it: the tile's asphalt is now trusted only where it reaches past the lane itself, otherwise kerbs, drops and the reach of the lanes decide. [ROLLBACK lane-107] on a road with several lanes each way a car no longer takes the traffic of the other carriageway for oncoming when its move round the player's vehicle stays within the next lane of its own direction; that lane is checked instead. [ROLLBACK bus-107] a timetable bus behind a bus at its stop, or behind the player's standing vehicle, comes up closer (0.3 m over its minimum gap) and starts its stop sooner (after 0.8 s standing in the bay).
- AI traffic: a road laid out as objects (no road spline under it) has no asphalt in the tile's road surface, so every cell of the ground grid read "no asphalt" and no car could bend its way round the player's vehicle there. Where the lane's own centre line has no asphalt, the ground now goes by kerbs and drops only and by how far the lanes reach (its own lane and the neighbour on the kerb side; on the oncoming side as far as the other carriageway's lane); beyond that is no road. The clearance wanted to the player's vehicle is 0.55 m by default. A timetable bus does not go round the player's vehicle (as before 105). [ROLLBACK object-106]
- Timetable buses: a bus coming up behind another bus standing at the same stop (one bay) comes close behind it (half a metre over its minimum gap, instead of two) and, once in its bay and still, serves the stop where it stands after 1.5 s instead of 6 s. [ROLLBACK bus-106]
- AI traffic: a car held up by the player's vehicle bends its own way round it instead of driving a shifted copy of the lane's way. The vehicle's box is a force field: where the way runs into it (grown by the car's half width and a margin) the way is pushed aside to just clear it, with room kept, and led back to the lane after it - a metre sideways over 8 m along when there is room, over 3 m at the steepest (the car stands close behind it, so it needs the room the bend takes; the lane may bend towards the vehicle, and the way follows what is needed there, not a fixed offset). Both sides are tried, and how much room is kept to the vehicle and to a kerb is traded; the cheapest is taken. The way is a list of points in the car's state (`lateral_curve`, omsi-sim), driven point by point. The ground grid and the way are one model for a few dozen metres and 30 s (the road does not change), so cars no longer probe the ground over and over, and a bend costs a handful of box tests. [ROLLBACK deform-105]
- AI traffic: whether the player's vehicle stands on the lane is judged by how much of its width lies in it (Developer Tools slider, default half): a corner reaching in is gone by with a bent way, never by overtaking on the oncoming lane; only a vehicle that stands on the lane is overtaken, and not while a bent way is under way. No bending or passing at a traffic light, a junction, a crossing or a fork of the road up to 25 m beyond the vehicle (it stands there to let the traffic through). [ROLLBACK deform-105]
- AI traffic: a timetable bus that has shut its doors (about to pull out, or running) and stands behind the player's vehicle may go round it like a car; before that, or when the stop is its own, it queues. [ROLLBACK deform-105]
- AI traffic: a car held up by the player's vehicle now looks over the road in front of it before it goes round: a grid of the ground (kerb, drop, no asphalt - along the whole stretch and across it up to 3 m either way), and every sideways move from one side to the other, each driven the way it really will be. The cheapest one that clears the vehicle, keeps off the kerb, and has nobody on the lane it reaches over onto (oncoming, or the next lane of its direction) is taken: the shortest move, with room kept to the vehicle and to the road's edge. The old limit of about 1.5 m sideways (which a van in a narrow lane could never use) is gone. The debug view `aicolls` draws every move tried (chosen thick green, possible pale green, vehicle in the way grey, bad ground red, traffic orange) and the ground grid; the Developer Tools window (AI debug page) has sliders for the values (furthest move, step, margins, clearances wanted, shortest and steepest move, costs, oncoming lane on/off, how often it looks again), with "Defaults" and "Copy values". [ROLLBACK corridor-104] [ROLLBACK tune-104]
- AI traffic: a car standing close behind the player's vehicle now really moves over. The sideways move was tried as if the whole offset were there at once, but the car drives it as an S-curve over a distance, and with only a few metres to the vehicle the way was still in its box when it got there - so the move was "chosen" and the car stood still for good. The way is now tried as it will be driven (the S-curve cut short to the room there is, from 2 m and 3 m to the metre of offset), and the debug view says when the box is still in the way. [ROLLBACK squeeze-103]
- [ROLLBACK avoiddbg-102] The AI debug view (`aicolls`) shows how a car goes round what stands in its way: the fallback in use (CORRECTION within the lane, OVERTAKE on the oncoming lane, or none yet), why each did not start, the way tried and the ground probed (green fine, red kerb, yellow drop, magenta no asphalt).
- [ROLLBACK squeeze-102] The correction within the lane also starts for a car that has already stopped a few metres behind the bus (it moves over more steeply, over the room there is), and a move over must have asphalt under the whole swath (an island, verge or pavement made of objects no longer passes for road).
- [ROLLBACK squeeze-101] AI cars go by the standing player's vehicle inside their lane when it sticks out a little (a bus half out of its bay): the smallest sideways move that clears it, up to a metre beyond the lane's edge, planned as soon as the bus is seen and without stopping first. Not towards the oncoming lane with somebody coming, and not over a kerb, island or drop (the wheel-level ground probe: a face 5-35 cm over the road, or a fall of more than 15 cm). A bus with its indicator out towards the traffic is waited for.
- [ROLLBACK buspass-101] Passing a standing bus on the oncoming side: the player's bus counts as standing after 4 s (was 10), a bus (the player's or an AI one) with its indicator out towards the traffic is not passed, and a pass begun round the player's bus is given up while the car is still behind it when the bus puts its indicator out.
- [ROLLBACK curve-101] The player's vehicle on a bend is seen as its own box only, no longer as the stretch along the circle ahead of it (it held up cars it never came near).
- [ROLLBACK queuestart-100] A queue pulling away from a light moves off more smoothly: a driver whose lead has started to roll runs out his reaction time three times as fast (about one driver in five keeps the old slow start).
- [ROLLBACK gameplay-99] Settings: "Cars around" and "Passengers" moved from the start's "Day & weather" step to the Gameplay tab; "Timetable vehicles" is now "Max timetable vehicles".
- [ROLLBACK paxvoice-99] "Passenger voices" (Sound tab) is replaced by three switches in Gameplay: passengers greet the driver (on), say which ticket they want (on) and complain (off by default).
- [ROLLBACK parkedpct-98] Parked cars: a new option "Parked cars" in percent of the car park spaces (default 75%, as the original's quarter of empty spaces), drawn for each space on its own when its tile loads. The old count limit (and its leaking counter) is gone, so tiles loaded later while driving get their cars like the ones at the start.
- [ROLLBACK lowpass-97] The cab's low-pass for outside sounds (own vehicle, traffic, surroundings) opens faster with `Snd_OutsideVol`: full at 0, 20% strength at 0.3, none from 0.5. The volume is unchanged.
- [ROLLBACK ambient-96] In the cab the traffic's and the surroundings' sounds (scenery sound sets) get the same attenuation and low-pass by `Snd_OutsideVol` as the own bus's outside sounds.
- [ROLLBACK parkedcap-96] The "parked cars" count is a soft ceiling: the tiles that loaded first no longer take all the cars and leave the rest of the map empty (more cars standing = fewer for each new tile, never below a quarter, stop at twice the count).
- [ROLLBACK crowd-96] Random traffic is placed by distance from the player (lane weight falls with distance), so a low AI count fills the streets around the player instead of spreading over 400 m.
- [ROLLBACK passplayer-96] AI cars no longer drive round the player's vehicle on the oncoming side before a light/junction (60 m) nor before it has stood 30 s.
- A passenger standing at an exit no longer walks back to the point before it and round again: whoever is at the exit's point stays there. [ROLLBACK exitstay-95]
- Walking past an open door of a bus no longer pulls the player in: the door must be within 45 cm (was 90 cm) and straight ahead. [ROLLBACK pull-95]
- Parked cars differ from run to run and each time a tile is loaded (they were drawn from the object's id alone: the same cars in the same car parks). [ROLLBACK parked-95]
- Setting the clock puts today's midnight and the date's tours where the new time says, so the timetable buses follow the new time. [ROLLBACK clockjump-95]
- A timetable bus on a break stops its engine for any wait over two minutes (was 3.5) and starts it a minute before the departure (was 75 s), also while its doors are open. [ROLLBACK engine-95]
- People who got off a bus look for a pavement within 10 m (was 30 m) and are gone at once when there is none; a pavement across the street no longer counts, so they stop walking into the bus. [ROLLBACK reach-93]
- People on foot collide with nothing any more - not each other, not shelters and posts, not the player's bus - so they no longer jam. [ROLLBACK nocoll-93]
- Paths marked "no unscheduled traffic" get no random AI cars and no pedestrians spawned on them (a `[rule]` with "unsched" in its name, or a set extra field of `[path_2]`). [ROLLBACK unsched-93]
- The launcher's tour lists (Drive and phone) show only the tours that run on the chosen day. [ROLLBACK tours-93]
- Setting the clock by hand takes the timetable's buses off the road and puts out the ones that are under way at the new time. [ROLLBACK clockjump-93]
- AI buses standing out a long layover also stop their engine sound, not just the lights. [ROLLBACK aiparked-93]
- AI list: the map picked on the page stays picked (it was put back on the Drive page's map every frame), and saving checks that the game will read what was written. [ROLLBACK ailist-93]
- A content path saved whole on another machine (`C:\Users\<name>\OMSI 2\Vehicles\...`) is found under this machine's content from its OMSI folder on. [ROLLBACK userpath-93]
- Route-arrow objects that mods tag `[routearrow]`, `[helper]` and the like are hidden with the route arrows, like `[helparrow]`. [ROLLBACK helper-93]
- Ray-traced reflections no longer warp the windscreen next to trees: with the camera inside the player's vehicle (F1/F2) the crossed tree cards are left out of the traced scene. [ROLLBACK tree-rt-92]
- Setting another time of day sends away the people waiting at the stops for buses that do not leave then, and fills the stops up at once with people for the buses that do (from the trips leaving within 20 minutes of the new time). A jump of the clock is noticed whichever way it came (the time dialog, the real-time sync, a host's clock); people already boarding stay.
- People appearing at the bus stops wait only for buses that leave for their destination soon: the destination is drawn from the trips that leave the stop within the next 20 minutes (trips with a line that run today and stop there, the player's duty among them), renewed every 15 s of the clock. They used to draw it from every trip of the timetable, so many waited for a night line twelve hours away or for a depot run and never got on; a stop nothing leaves from soon gets nobody. (`Schedule::soon_targets`)
- Nobody boarded the player's bus on a duty when its sign did not report a `target_index_int` row (an IBIS bus): it counted as showing no destination, i.e. out of service. The bus now takes its terminus from the IBIS (`IBIS_TerminusIndex` / `IBIS_TerminusCode`), and on a public duty trip from the trip when the sign tells nothing.
- Fewer people missed the bus: in free drive the player's bus now takes the people whose line lists the destination it shows (it took nobody before), and a bus counts as standing in a stop's box when the middle of its body is in it as well as its origin (an axle-origin bus missed a short box), a box being at least 6 m long.
- People on foot (passengers just off a bus among them) whose way leads into a standing bus or lorry now walk round it by its bounding box - through the corner of the nearer end and the one on its far side - instead of walking into its side and waiting. As a way out of any jam, somebody who has been held up for 4 s while wanting to go on passes through everything (people, vehicles, walls) for 1 s (it was 2.5 s and 1.5 s, and through people only).
- The "Open log" button of the developer tools window finds the game's log by the id the launcher gave the game (not only by its process), opens it only when the file exists, and otherwise shows the log folder of the current user instead of handing a missing path to the system. On Windows it is shown in Explorer.
- AI vehicles that have no spotlight of their own (no `[spotlight]`, `[spotlight_2]` or `[spotlight_cookie]`, in any section) light the road ahead at night: a `[spotlight_2]` pair is put at the front of the bounding box, 255 255 200, cones 20/60, reaching 50 to 65 m (drawn once per vehicle), switched by `AI_Light`. Only for the AI vehicles within 250 m of the camera.
- Passengers getting off no longer all run to the front door while no door is open yet (the search for an open exit gave the first exit of the list when none was open; in an articulated bus that sent people from the rear doors forward): they keep the nearest exit. And somebody whose own exit is still shut while another is open waits up to 12 s for it before going to the open one.
- The information bar's background is darker (less see-through) so that it no longer blends into the picture.
- New setting *Imperial units* (launcher: General; game menu): speeds in mph, distances in yards and miles and the odometer in miles on the information bar, the touch panel's speed, the navigator (speed, speed limit sign, turn and stop distances, scale bar) and the names over other players.
- The information bar's odometer sets the thousands apart (`1 433 243.3 km`).
- The information bar's odometer cuts the tenth of a kilometre off like the dials do (it rounded: 123468.8 read as 123468.9).
- The information bar (Shift+Y) shows the odometer reading (`ODO 12345.6 km`, the bus's `kmcounter`) and is see-through like the other plates, not opaque grey (it follows the opacity setting).
- AI list: `+` on a bus type adds the bus in the livery of the type's last bus (it came back in the default livery).
- AI list: the bus in the picture can be turned with the mouse again (the picture's rect was marked as interface, which kept the drag from reaching the showroom).
- AI list: a bus is added the way Drive picks one - manufacturer, model, livery, then a fleet number and a number plate of your own (or one from the bus's list) - with the bus (in the chosen livery) shown on the page. The livery, number and plate go into the entry line of `ailists.cfg`; a bus type the depot already has gets another line in its block.
- The launcher has an *AI list* page: the bus types of a map's depots from `ailists.cfg`, a switch for each, `+` / `-` for how many, and adding a bus type from the installed ones. Saved in the content folder (the map's own file stays), with a reset.
- AI timetable buses that wait 3.5 minutes or more at a terminus switch the engine off (`AI_Engine` 0), put the lights out and, in the dark, press the side-light switch (`kw_standlicht_toggle`) where the bus has one; the engine starts again 75 s before the departure.
- Free drive: the timetable shows the trip next to leave its first stop (a trip that left more than 20 s ago is not offered as the next).
- The small navigator's map zooms with the mouse wheel while the cursor is on it, on top of the automatic zoom with speed. A few seconds after the cursor leaves the panel the map eases back smoothly to the automatic zoom.
- Passengers no longer sit down in one another's seat: a passenger who moved to a seat that had been freed did not mark it as taken, so the next to board could choose it as well.
- Whether a passenger rides far is now told by the timetable: the minutes between their stop and their destination (under about 3 minutes they stand by the doors, over about 8 they sit, smooth between); without a timetable, a guess from the kilometres as before. The last free seats go only to those who ride far, and a short ride takes a seat only while many are free.
- Passengers off a bus no longer stand at its door for seconds: the standing bus beside them counted as a vehicle in the way (a wait of up to eight seconds); they now walk straight 1.8 m away from its side first, and then on along the pavement.
- Passengers who go deep into the bus take window seats. Some of the waiting (about one in five) wait and travel in twos to fours, with one destination: a pair takes two seats side by side, three or four a "four" (two benches of two facing each other) where the bus has one, otherwise they sit or stand near each other. Elderly passengers often go for the pilot's seat (across the aisle from the driver, a little behind the cab - whichever side the wheel is on), where the bus has one. All with *Passengers' wish to sit* above 0.
- Passengers choose their place: a seat or a standing place, instead of a random one. The ride (long: sit, short: stand by the doors), age (the elderly sit), the number of free seats, a window or an empty bench first, no standing close to others. A standing passenger on a long ride takes a seat that is freed, and now and then somebody gives their seat to an elderly passenger (at most once in 2.5 min per bus). Settings: *Passengers' wish to sit* (`pax_sit`, 0 = the original's random place, 0.5 .. 2x), in Gameplay and in the in-game *Traffic and people* list.
- Refuelling, charging, washing and a repair without travel time work within 5 m of a `[petrolstation]` object's box, so the bus no longer has to be driven into the pump.
- The interface key (Ctrl+Shift+H) works on foot as well.
- Passengers wait for a door that is opening for three seconds at most, and only entries count: whoever gets off goes to an exit once it is flagged open, as before, not to the exit point of a shut door.
- Passengers no longer turn away from the door that is being opened: a door whose variable is rising but which the script has not yet flagged open counts as open when an entry or exit is chosen, so they wait at it instead of walking to another door and back.
- Destination window: the list shows the identifier (the first string under the ZIEL number) of each destination, the window is wider, there are two search boxes over the list (by ZIEL code and by name), the depot file in use is named in the title and a button changes it.
- Lists and drop-downs (vehicle names, destinations, the launcher's selects) are as wide as their longest entry needs, within the screen, instead of cutting names off.
- Ctrl+Shift+H (`view_toggle_gui`, rebindable under Controls) hides and shows the interface layer - the navigator and map, notes, timetable, info bar, name tags, chat, tooltips and the frame rate; the game menu stays. Skipping the duty's next stop moved to Ctrl+Alt+H.
- Flying the map camera (F4): Ctrl slows it to a fifth, Shift speeds it up as before.
- On foot: the keys (W A S D, G, Space, C) can be moved under Controls, and F is a torch that goes out when the walker sits at the wheel.
- A vehicle moved with the map camera (F4) now stands facing the way the camera looks (horizontally), wherever on the window the click was, so its rear is seen from where it was put.
- The odometer is kept in a saved situation: continuing from it starts the counter at the saved reading instead of drawing a new one (it is also written for vehicles whose scripts do not declare `kmcounter_*`).
- Passengers who stepped off the player's vehicle and find no pavement are respawned, as in OMSI 2 (after a second, seen or not, so they do not crowd the doors), instead of standing there for good.
- View editor: opening it, choosing another mirror, or taking hold of a mirror's slider turns the driver's head to that mirror - to the glass that carries its `reflexionN` picture, or, where there is none in the cab, to the spot the mirror's camera is set at.
- Road surfaces: the pull towards the eye that settles flush layers is a tenth of what it was and capped at a few centimetres, so a surface that really is higher (a road over another, patches over asphalt) wins at every distance instead of the lower one showing through as the camera moves. `view_reset_all_directions` shows "View reset: main camera".
- `view_reset_all_directions` (Space) now also forgets the special camera the driver came from and re-syncs the view-look bookkeeping, so it always lands on the default straight-ahead camera with a centred view.
- Left/Right now switch the interior camera (`view_interiorcam_minus/plus`) even with a steering wheel connected; before, they only turned the head and just Ctrl+arrow switched cameras.
- Markings (or any decal object) laid a few millimetres over an asphalt object vanished close up and at an angle. The surface objects are pulled towards the eye along each vertex's line of sight (shader.wgsl, `vs_main`); the pull's share of the distance keeps every triangle a plane, but its fixed part (1 cm, 5 cm for a shadow blob) did not: across a big triangle seen from close by the lines of sight differ by tens of degrees and the pulled triangle bowed by millimetres, over the small triangles of what lies on it. Only the share of the way is kept now (`ZBOW_PLANAR`; the depth buffer's reversed float Z has the precision for the 0.1 % margin). [ROLLBACK zbow-57]
- Enhanced: the mirrors' dusk lift now begins earlier (`MIRROR_RISE` 0.5 to 3 in log2 of the pre-exposure, was 2 to 5): in the first part of the dawn the eye saw the street bright while the mirrors were still dark. `OMSI_DEBUG_MIRRORS=1` also logs, twice a second, the sun's height, the pre-exposure, the one the light asks for and their ratio ("mirror eye: ..."). [ROLLBACK mirrorrise-56]
- Enhanced: the vehicle mirrors and the eye adapt together. The street in the window is its rest picture times pre / pre_target (the pre-exposure takes 1.5 s to follow the light), the mirror's picture, lit by the hour at once, was not: after a quick change of the hour they settled differently. The mirror now carries the same factor (`MIRROR_EYE_SYNC`, `mirror_dusk_gain` in enhanced.wgsl; the pre-exposure the light asks for goes in `EnhancedUniform::eye.w`, lib.rs), and its dusk lift follows the light's hour, not the eye's lag. [ROLLBACK mirroreye-55]
- Enhanced: the vehicle mirrors at dusk and dawn still stood dark beside a window the eye had adapted to. The street in the window is lifted by the pre-exposure (about 2^6 in the blue hour), the plain light of the mirror's picture was not. The mirror now gets a lift over the dusk read from that same pre-exposure (`MIRROR_DUSK_BOOST` 3 and `mirror_dusk_gain` in enhanced.wgsl: none by day and at full night), on top of the eye adaptation it already follows; the light's dimming by the sun's darkness is kept to the deeper night (`MIRROR_DUSK_CURVE` 3). [ROLLBACK mirrorpre-54]
- Enhanced: the vehicle mirrors' level by the hour. Following the eye adaptation (mirrorada-52) lifted them at night, and at dusk and dawn they were still too dark. The mirror light's fall with the sun's darkness is now a curve (`MIRROR_DUSK_CURVE` 2: brighter in between, as dark as before at full night) and goes a little further at night (`MIRROR_NIGHT_DIM` 0.88, was 0.8). camera_util.rs. [ROLLBACK mirrorlevel-53]
- Sound: a triggered entry that starts audibly stays audible for the whole playback: its gain at the moment the trigger fired is held (the door hit's `[volcurve] doorSpeed_<n>` is reversed by the script a moment later and silenced the sound within a frame of its start). `LATCH_TRIGGERED` in soundset.rs (false = follows the curves as before). [ROLLBACK doorlatch-52]
- Enhanced: the vehicle mirrors follow the eye adaptation like the rest of the picture. They were held at their own brightness against the metering, so at dawn or dusk, or after a quick change of the hour, the street brightened (or whited out) and settled while the mirrors stayed dark. `MIRROR_FOLLOW_EV` in enhanced.wgsl (1 = follows, 0 = the picture of -50). [ROLLBACK mirrorada-52]
- Sound: a door's hit sound in a coupled section of an articulated bus (a `[trigger]` entry with `[volcurve] doorSpeed_<n>`) was silent: the section's entries read the curve at the frame's end, after the door script had reversed `doorSpeed_<n>`, while the front section's entries got the value of the moment the trigger fired. The sections get it too now, and the triggers of their entries are among those whose variables are kept (`update_parts_fired`, `curve_triggers` in soundset.rs; player.rs, traffic.rs). [ROLLBACK doorpart-51]
- Route arrows: with "Route arrows (as in OMSI 2)" on, the arrows the game generates along the route (over the junctions ahead, at the stops of the trip) came up together with the `[helparrow]` objects the map's author put up, and the map's own `dynhelperactive` flag (global.cfg), which Omsi.exe asks before it generates them, was read and never used. New setting "Generated route arrows" (`nav_arrows_auto`, off by default; launcher, in-game list and settings file): off, only the map's own arrows show; on, the generated ones stand as before. [ROLLBACK helpers-50]
- Enhanced: the vehicle mirrors (the `reflexionN` pictures) were far darker than in the plain picture. Their glass took only `texture x diffuse colour`, where the plain shading of an unlit surface adds the material's emissive colour too (a mirror material dark in its diffuse and bright in its emissive colour is a common way to show a picture at full brightness); and by a bright picture the tone mapping's metering (up to 0.6 EV off) darkened the mirror by a third as well, though its picture is the street already at its own brightness. Both are undone now (`MIRROR_EMISSIVE`, `MIRROR_UNMETER` in enhanced.wgsl; false = the old way). [ROLLBACK mirrordark-49]
- Walking outside a multi-section vehicle: every section has a collision again (section B had lost it) and a bridge box over each joint stops the walker walking into the articulation from outside. The walker's own-vehicle exclusions (getting up, stepping out) cover every section. Inside is unchanged. [ROLLBACK walkcoll-48] (`vehicle_sections` in on_foot.rs).
- Enhanced: a display's text layer (a blended, `[matl_noZwrite]` material with a `[matl_transmap]`, e.g. a LED matrix of two `[matl_change]`/`[matl]` blocks) lost its `[matl_lightmap]`, night map and LED light: it counted as a pane, and since devtools-38 a pane keeps only the sun and sky on its tint. A material with a light map, a night map or a display/LED light of its own now keeps its light. [ROLLBACK glass-48] in enhanced.wgsl.
- Sound on foot in an articulated bus: walking from the first section into the second (or across the joint, which has no bounding box) no longer switches the sound to the street's. The crossfade between the cab and the street now follows the highest of the boxes of every section and a bridge over each joint, and while the walker's cabin walk is on the player's own bus the sound is the cab's whatever the `[boundingbox]`es say (a bus with a wrongly sized box sounds right too). [ROLLBACK footsound-46] in `foot_cab_mix` (on_foot.rs) and its caller in app_events.rs.
- Enhanced: the "Lamp fill light" switch is gone from the launcher and the in-game list: the fill is always on. [ROLLBACK lampfill-47] (settings.rs forces `lamp_fill`; pages.rs and game_lists.rs lose the row).
- Enhanced: new setting "Lamp fill light" (`lamp_fill`, on by default): the street lamps' and headlamps' light now wraps a little round the terminator (`LAMP_WRAP` 0.25) and the light a lamp puts on the ground comes back from there to the surfaces facing away from it (`LAMP_BOUNCE` 0.22, over the lower hemisphere), so the far side of a vehicle from a lamp is no longer black at night. Off, the lamps' light is the plain Lambert term as before. [ROLLBACK lampfill-44] in enhanced.wgsl.
- LED matrices whose `[matl_alpha] 2`, `[matl_nightmap]` and `[matl_transmap] \S:n` stand after a `[matl_change]` (with no `[matl_item]`) showed every dot lit at all times: the slot was drawn opaque and its mask cut nothing. As in Omsi.exe (the parser at 0x5f4763), the commands after `[matl_change]` change the slot's base material, so their `[matl_alpha]` now counts as the slot's own. [ROLLBACK matlchange-42] in `material_alpha` (scene.rs).
- Enhanced: a pane with a reflection map is lit by the lamps at night without ray traced reflections: the lamps' light on the pane (street lamps, headlamps, lit fronts) lights the photograph it mirrors, in its tints, as a mid-grey surround would send it back (the sky probe alone is dark by night and the glass stood black and artificial). `ENVMAP_LIT_GLASS` / `ENVMAP_LIT_PAINT` / `ENVMAP_LIT_GAIN` in enhanced.wgsl [ROLLBACK envlit-41]; the traced reflections are unchanged.
- Enhanced: Enhanced+ is merged into Enhanced. The launcher's Graphics list no longer has Enhanced+; Enhanced has two new settings instead: "Ray traced shadows (and occlusion)" (`rt_shadows`) and "Ray traced reflections" (`rt_reflections`: Disabled - the reflection maps as before; On player vehicle only; Full - every reflecting surface). They switch independently (the traced shadows need a ray-tracing GPU; with both off the renderer is built without ray tracing). An old `graphics=enhanced_plus` / `--enhanced-plus` is read as Enhanced with both on (Full). Wet roads are still traced in a ray-tracing build, and the ambient occlusion stays traced there. [ROLLBACK rtsplit-40]
- Enhanced: the reflection maps (`[matl_envmap]`) turn with the camera, as in OMSI: Omsi.exe sets the sphere map's texture transform from the camera's yaw and pitch (offset -yaw/pi, -pitch/2pi), which the D3D wrappers and openOMSI left out, so the map looked flat and fixed to the screen. `ENV_SCROLL` in shader.wgsl (`sphere_map_uv`; 0 = the old behaviour) [ROLLBACK envscroll-40]. The Enhanced paint also samples the photograph through that sphere map now (`ENVMAP_SPHERE` in enhanced.wgsl; false = the old lookup) [ROLLBACK envmap-40].
- Enhanced: the `[matl_envmap]` paint (car bodies, bus panels) reflects more, as OMSI's sphere map does: its F0 reaches 0.16 for a full factor (0.08 before), the photograph's tint weighs 1.0 (0.65) and holds more on rougher paint (0.6 against 0.25). In Enhanced+ such a paint is traced as chrome and glass are (`ENVMAP_TRACED`); the old values stand in the comments of `enhanced.wgsl` under `[ROLLBACK envmap-39]`, the pane colour change under `[ROLLBACK glass-38]`.
- Enhanced: a pane (a window, a windscreen) shows of itself only the sun and sky on its tint and its reflection: the map's lamps, the saloon lamps and a glow of its own no longer add to its colour, which stood a dark tinted window grey and milky by day and at night.
- Enhanced+: the traced sun shadow showed its 4 x 4 pattern as large squares in the edge of a shadow far away on a road or the ground seen at a grazing angle: the filter that averages the rays took only neighbours at the same depth, and on such a surface the rows above and below lie metres apart. It now follows the surface's slope (the inverse depth is straight across a plane).
- Enhanced+: what the traced reflections show of the inside of the player's vehicle (the saloon behind the camera in the windscreen) is no longer a flat mean colour per texture. While the camera is in the vehicle, a **cabin probe** draws small pictures (512 px, one a frame) of the vehicle from three places - the camera, the middle of the vehicle and a quarter of its length behind that - six faces each, with the plain shading - real textures, the saloon lamps and all - and a reflection ray that meets anything within 40 m of the eye while the camera is in the vehicle (the dash and pillars and the rear part of a bendy bus lie outside the vehicle's bounding box) reads its colour from them (`render_cab_probe`, `CabProbe`). Where no face has been drawn yet it falls back to the earlier cabin shading. `OMSI_CAB_PROBE=0` switches it off (`OMSI_CAB_REFLECTION=0` too). A point the eye cannot see (a ray from the eye to it meets a surface first: behind the driver's seat, say) is not taken from the probe, which would show what stands in front of it. With the camera outside the vehicle (or in none) the same is done by a probe at the camera, six faces in the world's frame, for what is within 120 m of it. In the `OMSI_DEBUG_RT=11` view magenta marks the hits the probe had; `OMSI_DEBUG_RT=12` shows the probe's own colour there.
- Enhanced+: the traced reflections of what is off the screen (the saloon behind the camera in a window at night, a lit bus in a shop window) were black by night: a hit there was lit by the sun and the sky alone. A mesh the saloon lamps light now brings their light back (`Record` carries it, `lamp_level`), and a ray that meets the inside of the player's vehicle is lit as its cabin is. `OMSI_DEBUG_RT=11` draws what each reflection ray meets (green: sky, red: off the screen, blue: on it, yellow: the cabin).
- Sound: entering or leaving the vehicle in walk mode now crossfades the cab and street sound while the camera glides in or out (by the walker's position against the bus), instead of a dip. The own bus's outside sounds open from muffled to clear as they leave the cab.
- Passengers that stepped off the player's vehicle and found no pavement lane at once no longer stand still: they keep looking for one and set off when they find it.
- Wheel spray on wet roads is hidden more firmly in and right round the body the camera is in (passenger view included), and so is a vehicle's own `[smoke]` tyre spray (the stock `tire_wet_*` emitters), which was still drawn in the cabin.

* **`Velocity` and `Velocity_Ground` were one value.** As in Omsi.exe, `Velocity_Ground` is the
  body's speed over the ground and `Velocity` comes from the driven wheels (the mean of their
  turning speed times the tyre's size), so wheelspin or a locked wheel shows in it.
* **Text fields** (the launcher's and the developer tools') copy, cut and paste the selection,
  Ctrl+Backspace / Ctrl+Delete remove a word, Ctrl+arrows move by word and Shift+arrows select.
* **The mouse wheel over a cockpit switch** no longer clicks it; it zooms the view (field of view) as everywhere else.

### Changed

* **Smooth viewpoint changes** (`driverview_smooth`) now glide as Omsi.exe does it (found in its
  camera code): every frame the view comes closer to the new camera by `1 - exp(-0.005 * ms)` of
  what is left - the eye, the field of view and the heading and height each on their own - so a
  quick start and a long soft tail instead of a fixed-length curve. The eased return of the view
  (Space / F1) uses the same law.
* **The driver's view turns with the steering only in the default driver view** (straight ahead);
  the other cockpit views no longer turn.
* **Esc → Camera** no longer carries the seat-position and head-pitch sliders; the view is
  adjusted in the view editor panel (the single button there), per vehicle. The global field of
  view slider stays.
* **The own bus's outside sounds heard in its cab** (the engine from outside and the like) go
  through a low-pass filter as well as being turned down - but only while the bus's script lets
  them in: with `Snd_OutsideVol` at 0 they are not heard at all, as before. The filter's
  cutoff rises with `Snd_OutsideVol` (500 Hz at 0.01 to wide open at 0.95). The traffic gets no
  filter.
* **Getting in or out of the bus on foot** no longer cuts the sound between the street and
  the cab: the sounds of the old view fade out in 0.2 s, those of the new one in over 0.3 s,
  and the traffic heard through the bodywork slides to its cab level in half a second.
* **Oncoming cars no longer stop for the player on a bend.** They looked for the player's
  bus in a box stretched straight ahead of its nose, which on a bend reaches over into the
  opposite lane. The stretch ahead of the nose now follows the circle the bus is driving
  (its turn per metre, from the change of its heading).
* **F4 (map camera)**: a plain click on the ground (no Ctrl) now asks "Do you want to move the
  vehicle here?" and, on yes, puts the vehicle there - anywhere, not only on a street (Enter =
  yes, Esc or a click beside the question = no).

### Added
- Setting "Refuel and wash anywhere": the pump and the wash no longer ask for a petrol station nearby. [ROLLBACK petrol-93]
- Developer tools: an "AI debug" page. It shows what the player's bus sign says (`target_index_int` and the depot row it names, the IBIS's terminus, what the game takes the sign to be, how the bus takes people, the duty's trip) together with the nearest stop's line records and buses listed, and switches overlays over the picture: above every person what they do (task, stop, destination, the line record and termini they expect, the bus they deal with, why they stand), their planned ways, the lanes the cars mean to drive, and what the cars' collision detection sees (box, the nearest thing ahead, lead car and gap, a body in the way, red light, yielding).
- `OMSI_NO_FRUSTUM_CULL=1`: the window's picture draws the whole scene whatever the camera sees (behind it, outside the view, beyond the fog) - a test for the traced reflections. Expensive; the size, distance and level-of-detail limits still apply.
- Enhanced+ (experimental): the player's own windows seen from the cab now mirror the cabin - its walls, seats and, at night, the saloon's lamps - as strongly as the cabin is brighter than the street outside (nothing by day, clearly at night), where they showed a flat 15 % of the sky's reflection at any hour. The ray meets the cabin lit as the cabin is, not by the sun and sky outside. `OMSI_CAB_REFLECTION=0` switches it off.

* **Mirror editor** in the developer tools window (tab *Mirror editor*): every
  `[add_camera_reflexion]` of the vehicle and its coupled parts with sliders and fields for
  position, dist, field of view, yaw, pitch and extra, set live in the game (never saved); *Copy*
  puts the finished `[add_camera_reflexion_2]` block on the clipboard to paste into the `.bus`.
* **View editor**: Esc → Camera... → *Edit the driver's view and mirror angles* opens a
  translucent panel on the right with sliders for the driver's eye, view, field of view and for each mirror's
  angles, kept for that vehicle alone (`driverview.cfg`, `mirrors.cfg`).
* **Developer tools window**: Ctrl+Shift+Backspace in the game opens an extra window
  beside it, whatever the setting says (a process of its own; closing it only closes the window, and
  it closes by itself when the game ends); Settings → General → *Open Developer Tools with every session*
  starts it automatically. *Reload passenger cabin* and *Reload paths* read the player's
  `[passengercabin]` or `paths.cfg` again while playing; further buttons read `sound.cfg`,
  the `.bus` file(s) (cameras, mirrors, bounding boxes, physics), `model.cfg` (lights, animations,
  object properties) and the constfiles (constants and curves) again, each one all or nothing. Overlays also show mirrors (position and the way they are turned),
  the center of gravity, driver and passenger views and tyre widths; an *Open log* button opens
  the game's log. In
  it: switches that draw the seated places (orange dots), the standing places (red dots), the
  passengers' paths, the vehicle's bounding box, the axles and wheels and the interior lights (with
  their number and variable), the numbers and uses of the path points (entry, exit, links,
  ticket sale, stamper) and the ticket sale, stamper, money and change points over the picture, and the player vehicle's
  variables and strings - watch, set, hold, and save the watched names as named lists.

* **`(M.V.GetRadioName)` and `(M.V.GetRadioSong)`**: script callbacks that return the internet
  radio's station name (`icy-name`, else the name in `radio.cfg`) and its stream title as strings;
  empty while the radio is off. See MODDING.md.

* **Bus radio from the cab**: the radio plays from a point by the driver's camera; inside it is
  semi-spatial (slightly quieter with distance, slightly to the radio's side, smoothed over ~0.5 s and
  following the bus's axes so changing views never swings it between the ears). Optional effects in
  Settings → Sound (launcher and in-game), off by default: sliders *Cheap speaker*, *FM hiss and
  crackle*, *Lost reception* (`radio_fx_speaker`, `radio_fx_noise`, `radio_fx_dropouts`, 0..1).

* **`[led_glow_effect]`** (0-1, in a `[matl]` block): the material's lit parts glow like an LED
  panel's dots in the enhanced picture, at that fraction of the *LED glow* setting; 0 keeps the glow
  off it. It works on any material of a vehicle or a scenery object - with a light map it glows where
  that is lit, with a night map by that, with neither all over. See MODDING.md. (`omsi-model`,
  `scene.rs`, `enhanced.wgsl`, `post.wgsl`)

* A **trip summary** window when a trip is over (the bus stopped at its last stop with a passenger
  door open): the line and the tour's number and a table of the stops - planned and real arrival,
  difference, planned and real departure, difference and the bus's odometer, `---` where a stop was
  never served - to copy (Ctrl+C) or save as a text file in `Journeys` (Ctrl+E). It does not pause the
  game. The setting *Show a summary after each trip* (Settings → Gameplay, the game menu's options)
  switches the windows off. The journey log has the odometer column and `---` for missed stops too.
  (`trip_summary.rs`, `journey.rs`)

* The quick menu (**Alt** tapped alone, as in OMSI 2): twelve tiles in the lower right corner -
  place, swap and remove a vehicle, teleport to a start point, line and tour, destination display,
  repair, refuel and wash, route arrows, time, weather and game controllers - an overlay that does
  not pause the game. The tiles that choose something open the game menu on that list at once,
  without its pause, and it closes when the list is done. While a timetable is active, the
  line-and-tour tile becomes the one that ends it (red, with a cross): a click asks first, then the
  game drives free as *Free drive* in the list of lines does. (`quick_menu.rs`)

### Changed

* **Launcher, Drive → Day & weather: the time and date can be changed again with "Start on today's date" on.**
  The old "Start at the real time" switch is gone (it, and the date switch, overwrote the fields every
  frame and at every launch, so they could not be edited). The *Current time* and *Current date*
  buttons are always there for a one-click sync of either. "Start on today's date" now sets the date
  and year from the computer's calendar once, when the launcher opens; after that the date is yours.

* The LED glow is no longer given automatically to every material with a `\S:n` transmap and a
  white light map: only a material with `[led_glow_effect]` glows. A panel of a mod that should
  keep its glow needs the key in its `model.cfg`.

* The tour's next trip begins as soon as the bus has stopped at the last stop of a trip with a
  passenger door open, as in OMSI 2 (before: only after the bus had left the terminus by 60 m, within
  five minutes of the trip's time), so that the timetable and the IBIS delay show the time to the
  departure at once and the passengers board for the new trip.

### Fixed

* Choosing a timetable (*Line and tour*, from the Esc menu or the quick menu) no longer types the
  line and destination into the bus's IBIS or roller blind by itself, and the displays no longer
  follow the duty from trip to trip afterwards: the driver sets them at the bus's own controller, as
  in OMSI 2. What still does it, on request: Shift+U (the start-up macro) and a game started with
  *Put the bus into service on start* (`--autostart`).
* A game started without *Timetable buses* had no timetable in it: *Line and tour* (Esc menu and
  the quick menu) said "No timetable on this map". The map's timetable is now read when the list is
  first opened; the timetable buses on the road stay off unless the game was started with them. A
  timetable with no tour running at the game's time says so instead of "no timetable".

### Removed

* **"Driver's hands in the cab view"** is gone from Settings and the pause Options; the hands are no
  longer shown in the cab view.
* **Android** is no longer described in the README, the user guide, the build and versioning docs or the
  website (the `docs/ANDROID.md` page is removed). The code is untouched.
* The updater, completely: the launcher no longer asks GitHub for a newer release when it starts
  or every half hour, the game no longer looks for one during a session and downloads nothing in
  the background, and nothing replaces the program (no `.openomsi-update` swap, no relaunch).
  Gone with it: the settings *Look for updates when the launcher starts*, *Install updates
  without asking* and *Tell me about a new version during a session* (an old `settings.cfg`'s
  `update_*` lines are ignored), the switches `OMSI_NO_UPDATE` and `OMSI_UPDATE_URL`, the update
  dialog and cards, and on Android the APK installer and the `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES`
  permission. A newer build is installed by hand.
* The "playing now" counter: the game no longer tells a Cloudflare Worker
  (`openomsi.savvabestbrother.workers.dev`) every ten minutes that it is being played. Gone with
  it: the setting *Count me in the website's "playing now"*, `OMSI_NO_PRESENCE` and
  `OMSI_PRESENCE_URL`, `services/presence/` and the counter on the website and in the README.
* The launcher no longer rests while a game runs: it keeps its window and its graphics device and
  stays usable (the setting *The launcher rests while a game runs* and the dark cover over the
  window are gone; an old `launcher_rest` line in `settings.cfg` is ignored). Instead the buttons
  that start a session (Start the duty / Drive, Continue, Start the lesson) are faded while a
  game runs or is starting, and work again when it ends. A second game from the launcher (the
  second click on the start button, for testing LAN play on one computer) is no longer offered.

## 0.1.1554 - 2026-10-05

### Fixes
- Enhanced+ ray tracing works on Windows and Linux again (RTX and RDNA 2 cards and newer, Direct3D 12 and Vulkan), not only on Apple silicon: on Direct3D 12 its shaders were refused by the shader compiler, so every frame was thrown away and the picture stood still on the loading screen. Cut-out leaves and fences also cast their full traced shadows on Vulkan and Direct3D 12 now.
- Should a graphics driver refuse the ray tracing all the same, Enhanced+ falls back to Enhanced instead of freezing.

## 0.1.1553 - 2026-10-05

### Fixes
- Enhanced+ no longer stops drawing at the end of the loading screen on Windows and Linux: its ray tracing is used on Apple silicon (Metal) only for now, and elsewhere Enhanced+ draws as Enhanced. The graphics library's ray tracing on Vulkan and Direct3D 12 is still experimental; `OMSI_RT=1` tries it.

## 0.1.1552 - 2026-10-05

### Fixes
- "Playing now" stays up all day: the game reports every ten minutes instead of every three and waits half an hour when the counter is busy, and the website asks every five minutes - the counter had run out of its daily requests and answered nobody until midnight UTC.

## 0.1.1551 - 2026-10-05

### New
- Enhanced+ graphics (Settings → Graphics, `--enhanced-plus`): hardware ray tracing on Apple M3/M4 and newer, RTX and RDNA 2 cards - ray-traced sun shadows (soft away from their caster, crisp at the contact), ambient occlusion and reflections: wet roads, puddles, water, glass and chrome mirror what really stands around them, off the screen too. Elsewhere it draws as Enhanced.
- Natural light in Enhanced and Enhanced+: the sky is computed from the physics of the atmosphere (multiple scattering, ozone, the day's haze and its particle size, a stratospheric layer), so the blue hour, the twilight's purple and every sunset look their own. Clouds glow after the sun has set for the street, a veil of high cloud gives a milky sun with soft pale shadows, passing cumulus take the sun away and bring it back, the moon stands at its real place with its real phase and lights the night, stars show in a dark sky and a city lights its own clouds. A camera's tone curve and exposure, street lamps as bright points with a little glare (wide halos in mist and rain).
- Natural weather (the default when no weather is chosen, `--weather natural`): a physical weather model instead of one fixed state. Highs and lows pass through, cumulus grows in the afternoon and dissolves in the evening, calm clear nights leave morning fog, fronts bring a grey deck and rain, snow lies in winter and thaws in a mild spell, rain leaves clear air behind - grey days, blue evenings and sunny mornings follow from the days before, as the season and the map's latitude allow.

### Fixes
- Vehicle shadow blobs no longer flicker against the road, and in Enhanced and Enhanced+ they darken the ground under the bus as in OMSI 2.

### Merged pull requests
- Performance: vehicle scripts run about a quarter faster [#1328](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1328), and finding the ground under the wheels costs about a quarter less CPU [#1334](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1334), with the same results.
- Texture memory: on Linux with NVIDIA's driver the card's memory is read from Vulkan, and cards over 6 GB get more automatic texture memory [#1320](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1320).
- Automatic start-up no longer releases the starter too early (Volvo 7900H, HH109, WSW C2), the stock buses unchanged [#1147](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1147).

## 0.1.1515 - 2026-10-04

### New
- Multiplayer: every variable of the other players' buses (floats and strings: gearbox, displays, IBIS, ticket printer, plugin values) is synced, so their buses look and behave as they do for their drivers.
- Updates during a session: the game looks for a new version, downloads it in the background and says so over the navigator; it is installed when the session ends. The cards can be switched off (Settings → General → "Tell me about a new version during a session").
- The launcher looks for updates again every 30 minutes while it is open and after a game ends, not only when it starts.
- "Playing now": the website and the README show how many people play openOMSI right now. The game sends only a random per-session id, its version and the kind of system; switch it off under Settings → General.

### Fixes
- Updates no longer fail with "Timeout" on a slow or unsteady connection: requests are tried again, a broken download goes on where it stopped, and github.com is asked when the GitHub API does not answer.

- Texture memory is no longer capped at 2 GB on cards with more, and the VRAM of AMD cards on Linux is read [#1137](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1137).
- Android: a black screen on Adreno 6xx, 7xx and 8xx chips is avoided by rebuilding their shader cache [#1310](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1310).
- Translations: Simplified Chinese [#1282](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1282), Traditional Chinese [#1264](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1264), Polish [#1262](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1262) and French [#1251](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1251).

## 0.1.1423 - 2026-10-04

- Build: the small-BAR fix for NVIDIA cards ([#905](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/905)) now comes from the project's own copy of gpu-allocator, not a personal fork.

## 0.1.1422 - 2026-10-04

### Merged pull requests
- Performance: script names are looked up without allocating and debug switches read once [#1292](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1292), a wheel's ground probe walks its cell's faces once [#1287](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1287), a render origin moved sideways rewrites only the models' translations [#1283](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1283), an instance given another mesh is updated alone [#1280](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1280), the AI vehicles' heaviest scripts each get a job of their own [#1260](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1260), traffic light lamps are set again only when what they show changed [#1259](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1259), and the instances are culled by blocks of 128 before one by one [#1256](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1256).
- AI cars no longer drive through red lights, and a car put on the road in front of a red light comes in slowly enough to stop [#1253](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1253).
- The outside camera is no longer trapped under buses whose orbit centre lies below the ground clearance [#1246](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1246).
- Crash reports carry the computer, its graphics card and the map, and their title is the error alone [#1225](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1225).
- Dedicated servers: a player who drives a bus the `vehicles` list of `server.cfg` does not allow is sent away and told which buses the server has [#1222](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1222) (the vehicle menu offers only those since 0.1.1382).
- Bus stops put on splines are placed right in the map index before their tiles load, so a duty's stops and the announcements are right from the start [#1208](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1208).
- Terrain holes: the ground's exposed edges along spline and object cuts are closed by walls textured like the ground around them [#1069](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1069).
- Linux: a gear shifter or a button box (a device with buttons only) can be set up [#1059](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1059).
- NVIDIA cards without Resizable BAR (Vulkan): uploads no longer go to the small BAR heap, which made loading take minutes and the game run at a few fps [#905](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/905).
- [#1223](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1223): the same OpenGL fix (Intel HD 2500, Mali) was already in 0.1.1382.

## 0.1.1382 - 2026-10-04

Bug Fixes & Improvements

## 0.1.1313 - 2026-10-03

### Triple screens
- Native triple-screen support with the HUD on the centre screen
  ([#1127](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1127)), merged with fixes: the three
  panels are drawn at one size (the depth, AO and rain targets were made anew twice a frame),
  SSAO on the angled side panels, traffic and pedestrians no longer appear or vanish on them,
  fullscreen and Alt+Enter leave a spanned window alone, nothing is drawn after a lost device,
  and the Display page shows the rig's settings only while it is on. A single screen draws
  exactly as before.

## 0.1.1302 - 2026-10-03

### Fixes
- The Drive page's map no longer fills with the interface's words after a game or a lost
  graphics device: the launcher kept the map's texture number from its old device, and a
  number past the new device's textures was drawn with the font atlas.
- The game starts again on every system: Steam's rich presence ([#996](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/996)) is built only where
  its library exists (Windows x64, Linux x64, macOS), the library is put beside the program
  (also for the servers and a Linux build, which could not find it), and Android, Windows ARM64
  and macOS build again (0.1.1246 was not released because of it).
- The window losing the focus or being minimised lets go of every key, button and mouse
  steering held, and takes no input until it is back; a minimised game runs at 30 fps.

### Merged pull requests
- Voice chat in sessions through GreenTeaSpeak, players heard where they are [#1102](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1102) - with a
  key handshake between the game and the plugin (a web page can no longer drive it), the voice
  server's id required, and the plugin putting the user's name and channel back.
- Resumed sessions keep the bus displays and the timetable's place, and the IBIS moves on to
  the next trip [#1087](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1087).
- The server's notifications over the navigator [#974](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/974), a duty given by the server [#985](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/985),
  a fresh hello after the WebSocket is made again [#980](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/980), the paint the bus wears now seen by
  the other players [#1022](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1022).
- Controllers: latching switches [#1060](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1060), Linux wheels no longer buzz [#1042](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1042); one key between
  cabin and outside [#1007](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1007).
- Rendering: the render origin no longer flips while the camera is near it [#1126](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1126), the
  ICU400 sign controller shows its text [#993](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/993), fewer meshes turned inside out [#1105](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1105);
  Chinese AI car plates [#1002](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1002); Volvo Wright rear doors [#1125](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1125).
- Tile loading diagnostics [#1111](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1111), cloudflared without console windows [#1001](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1001), Simplified
  Chinese [#1028](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1028), the radio documented [#1124](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1124), the release history filled in [#1130](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1130).

## 0.1.1246 - 2026-10-03

### AI traffic
- A car stopped behind a parked car just past a joint between road pieces pulls out round it:
  a lane change now carries on across the joint, so cars no longer queue for good behind a
  parked car on short road pieces ([#1055](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/1055)).
- A car held for a long time by nothing anybody can see is taken away even in view, and a
  car creeping a few centimetres at a time counts as standing; people and cars on a bridge
  above or in a subway below no longer stop a car.
- AI cars give way to the player's bus by the same rules as to each other - at junctions,
  where lanes merge, and when the bus is in the junction - and let a bus out of a stop when it
  indicates towards the road (for 20 s at most).

### Maps
- Route arrows show street and stop names in Cyrillic and other scripts their font lacks,
  drawn with the interface font in the arrow's colour.

## 0.1.1234 - 2026-10-03

### Launcher
- The Drive page is laid out again, in three steps - the bus, the day and the weather, the map
  and the duty. The column on the left is a solid panel; the bus or the map has a stage of its
  own on the right, the roadbook beside the map, and a foot under it sums the choice up with
  the buttons in a row. Nothing lies over the map or shows through a panel any more, the line
  and tour rows have room for their text, stop names keep off each other and inside the map,
  the lists stretch with the window, and the roadbook opens on your first trip.

### Graphics and devices
- OpenGL chips without storage buffers in the vertex shader (Intel HD 2500, Mali on GLES) draw
  the scene from textures instead of failing to start (`OMSI_GPU_ARRAYS=textures` forces it). [#770](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/770) [#316](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/316)
- The Vulkan and OpenGL interfaces are only started when DirectX 12 cannot draw, so their
  loader no longer breaks a DirectX 12 start on dual-GPU laptops. [#1058](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/1058) [#1044](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/1044)
- A chip without a DirectX 12 driver draws on its own Vulkan or OpenGL instead of Microsoft's
  software renderer. [#770](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/770)
- Script, text and HTML textures larger than the chip takes are halved until they fit.
- A window the system cannot open ends with a message instead of a panic report.
- A script value that is not a number no longer turns the bus to NaN and stops the game. [#1045](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/1045)

## 0.1.1223 - 2026-10-03

### Driving and controls
- The cab's steering wheel turns as far left as right: `Axle_Steering_N_L` and `_R` carry the
  axle's one angle, as Omsi.exe hands it to the scripts, not each tyre's Ackermann angle. [#953](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/953) [#1073](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/1073)
- A steering or pedal key let go while Shift is held, or while the game menu is open, lets go
  instead of turning the wheel on to full lock. [#1040](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/1040) [#1050](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/1050) [#1053](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/1053)
- Mouse steering switched off in the game menu keeps the brake on, as the O key does. [#517](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/517) [#760](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/760)
- Ctrl+click on the ground in the free view (F4) moves the bus to the nearest street there. [#1039](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/1039)
- The engine-off hint names the player's own key for the electrics. [#461](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/461)

### Timetable and passengers
- An early timetable bus waits at its stop until 20 s before its departure (a train 2 min), as
  in Omsi.exe, instead of leaving after 40 s. [#1012](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/1012)
- A tour that repeats the same trip no longer leaves its bus at the trip's last stop for good. [#976](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/976)
- Stops hung on another object (`[attachObj]`) are on the route map, and a duty's stop whose
  tile was not loaded at the start is reached once it loads. [#1014](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/1014) [#975](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/975)
- People leaving a bus walk onto the pavement at their own pace instead of sliding sideways. [#1033](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/1033) [#1079](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/1079)

### AI traffic and maps
- A map without `unsched_vehgroups.txt` takes its random traffic from the default AI group alone,
  as Omsi.exe does. [#1025](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/1025)
- AI cars whose road is drawn more than 0.3 m under their lane come down onto it instead of
  driving in the air. [#876](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/876)
- A signal that names no crossing is still a lamp, and reads phase 0 as in Omsi.exe. [#988](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/988)
- A terrain object lying outside its own tile is not drawn, as in OMSI (leftovers of copied
  tiles no longer stand in the road). [#787](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/787)

### Graphics
- Texture names stored in a Korean, Chinese or Japanese code page are found. [#990](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/990)
- A `[rendertype] surface` object with `[matl_alpha] 2` on a texture without alpha is opaque, so
  roads behind it no longer show through. [#1008](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/1008)
- Enhanced: the custom weather's brightness no longer darkens the mirrors; a white light map no
  longer bleaches displays and gauges at night. [#1018](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/1018) [#827](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/827)
- Vanilla+: the sphere map is blended on encoded colours as in Vanilla and Omsi.exe, so
  reflections are no longer twice too strong over dark surfaces. [#780](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/780)
- A mesh borrowed from another vehicle pack keeps the winding of its own pack. [#977](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/977) [#1054](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/1054)

### Menus and platforms
- Scroll bars of the game menu's drop-downs and of a line's stop list can be dragged. [#794](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/794)
- Names macOS stores decomposed (the weather "Eiseskälte") show their accented letters.
- A bus whose `[boundingbox]` has a negative size no longer stops the game. [#986](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/986)
- macOS: a fresh openOMSI.app in Applications keeps its content in `~/.openomsi/content` instead
  of creating OMSI's folders among the applications; content already installed there stays. [#1043](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/1043)

## 0.1.1196 - 2026-10-03

### Roads and driving
- Roads are drawn at their own height again and win over the ground by the surfaces' depth bias,
  as in Omsi.exe; the 8 cm lift is gone, so footways no longer stand over the ground aligned to
  them and markings no longer sink under the road. [#1077](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1077)
- The bumps of a road texture's `.surf` map (cobbles, slabs, broken asphalt) are felt under the
  wheels, on splines and on junction objects alike (`OMSI_NO_SURF=1` for an A/B). [#1056](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1056)
- Train cars stand end to end by their model bodies, not by their declared coupling points
  (a CR200J's second car no longer sits 2.6 m inside the first). [#1016](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1016)

### Graphics
- Wet-road reflections work in Vanilla and Vanilla+ as well as Enhanced, also seen through the
  bus's own windows; rain films no longer feed the previous frame back into themselves. [#970](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/970)
- The texture fallback index looks into archives and content installed while the game runs. [#1029](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1029)

### Maps and launcher
- On the navigator and city map, trolleybuses, buses and trams have their own colours and show
  their line. [#992](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/992)
- The Drive page shows the map itself: its roads, entry points and the chosen line's route. [#943](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/943)
- A server whose map is not installed here can be joined: the map comes with the server's mods. [#1076](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/1076)

## 0.1.1169 - 2026-10-03

### Graphics
- A declared `[matl_transmap]` whose image is missing still keeps its opaque texture slot, as
  Omsi.exe does, so traffic bodies that use diffuse alpha as a reflection mask are no longer
  half transparent.

## 0.1.1166 - 2026-10-02

### Graphics
- A vehicle's blended layers write depth unless `[matl_noZwrite]`, exactly as Omsi.exe sets its
  states (0x7fd6c4), and are drawn in model order with no reordering: stacked panes (door glass
  with dirt, decals on glass) no longer see through each other. The vehicle the camera is in is
  drawn after the whole scene and its own lamp flares after it, as in Omsi.exe. [#211](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/211) [#596](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/596)
- A 16-bit TGA keeps its alpha bit (A1R5G5B5, as D3DX reads it).

### Sound
- Sounds are mixed as in Omsi.exe's sound update (0x750340): the volume is checked against
  0 dB after the distance factor (DirectSound keeps the last volume when asked for more), a loop's
  pitch outside 100-200,000 Hz is refused and the last rate kept (the LiAZ and trolleybus
  "whine" played 30x too fast), AI vehicles use viewpoint 4, sounds of other vehicles heard from
  the cab are x(0.2 + Snd_OutsideVol) with no invented filter, only `[3d]` sounds are panned
  (5 dB at most), Doppler only on loop sounds, conditions compared exactly.

### Passengers and cash desk
- Coins lie flat on the change tray at random spots and turns, as Omsi.exe places them, instead
  of a tower that grew 3 mm a coin.
- People come from one pool, as in Omsi.exe: `ai_max_humans` (OMSI's `[AIMaxCountRandom]`,
  200 by default), walkers at most half of it. A waiting place another stop's person stands on
  is not free, so no two people stand inside each other.
- A duty moves on to the next trip when the bus stands at its first stop a minute before
  departure, so the IBIS is no longer left on the old terminus with riders refusing to board.

### Physics
- AI wheels each stand on the highest drawn face up to 3 m above them, as Omsi.exe's ground
  query (0x7a0814): no more cars sunk into cambered roads or hidden inside roads above the lane.
- A wheel no longer falls through the hair-wide seam between two spline segments (an 18 cm drop).

### Menu and website
- The pause menu uses the launcher's greys, switches, sliders and scroll bars, follows the
  Interface size, and lists destination codes in a column.
- The website has a light theme (and a theme button), readable colours, and no sideways
  scrolling on phones.

## 0.1.1147 - 2026-10-02

### Mirrors
- In the cab, Ctrl+M can put copies of the bus's mirrors over the picture; Ctrl+Shift+M opens
  an editor to move, resize, add, aim and zoom them. Layouts are saved per bus. [#920](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/920)

### LAN and chat
- After a LAN connection times out, the client keeps trying the host and can rejoin without
  restarting the game; `/reconnect` retries immediately. [#926](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/926)
- Long chat messages wrap onto following rows instead of being cut with an ellipsis. [#969](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/969)
- A dedicated server behind a local web gateway logs the player's forwarded address, so the
  operator can distinguish clients that would otherwise all appear as loopback. [#962](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/962)

### Radio
- A bus radio display can show the station and song that are actually playing. A map can supply
  its own stations in `radio.cfg` and give them frequencies by position on the map. [#945](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/945)

### Graphics and textures
- In Enhanced, a soaked road has puddles in patches instead of becoming one mirror from kerb
  to kerb. [#950](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/950)
- A missing scenery or spline texture can be found from another folder of the same content
  type when the installation contains a matching image. [#912](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/912)
- In Vanilla+, terrain under street lamps keeps its ground colour instead of getting a white
  or beige veil at night. [#935](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/935)

### Routes and input
- Route numbers with symbols, such as `-10`, are kept as written from a HOF or manual input
  and work on destination displays; the free route-number field accepts keyboard symbols. [#967](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/967)

## 0.1.1122 - 2026-10-02

### Graphics
- In Vanilla+, terrain no longer gets a white veil at night.
  [#935](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/935)

## 0.1.1120 - 2026-10-02

### Passengers and doors
- A timetable bus waits only for the people walking up to its doors from the stop it serves and
  those getting off, as Omsi.exe does, so a full bus no longer stands with open doors for ever. [#767](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/767)
- People off a bus walk on along the pavement instead of milling round each other at the stop. [#913](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/913)
- A controller button or a keyboard.cfg key can work door 1-9 front to back, or all doors
  (`door_1` ... `door_9`, `doors_all`). [#916](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/916)
- A second Shift+1 shuts both front leaves of the SD202 again.

### Graphics
- A transmapped car body is see-through only where its transmap is: AI cars are no longer half
  transparent, with wheel arches showing through. [#928](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/928) [#932](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/932)
- A night or light map named in a paint scheme's `[CTCTexture]` is the scheme's picture. [#895](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/895)
- An active chrono event that reshapes a tile brings its own terrain and water. [#923](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/923) [#925](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/925)
- A full beam reaches as much further than the low beam as its `[spotlight]` range says. [#941](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/941)
- A see-through layer drawn in model order (a sticker on a window) is no longer painted over by
  the opaque parts listed after it. [#918](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/918)

### Traffic
- A scripted child of a crossing that names one of its lights reads that light's phase, so such
  traffic lights no longer flash yellow. [#922](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/922)

### Vehicles
- The rear section's wheels of an articulated bus spring on the road under each of them. [#901](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/901)
- Textures waiting to be compressed go up at half size meanwhile, so a big articulated bus no
  longer runs a 3 GB graphics card out of memory while loading. [#921](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/921)
- A bus takes its own depot file of the map's place before another bus's. [#896](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/896)
- A four-digit line such as 7110 keeps its number on the IBIS. [#459](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/459)

### Launcher, menu and input
- The launcher keeps "Hold manual gear buttons", and the pause menu's switch applies to the bus.
- The passenger view (F2) turns all the way round. [#909](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/909)
- "Camera..." in the pause menu opens the driver's view settings. [#908](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/908)
- On OpenGL no thread polls the GPU beside the one drawing (a crash at start). [#898](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/898)
- The minimap can be dragged anywhere on the screen. [#940](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/940)
- Ctrl+Up / Ctrl+Down (gear up and down) are keys of the list that can be moved or cleared. [#907](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/907) [#930](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/930)
- A window size can be chosen (Graphics > Window size); under gamescope the game opens full screen. [#904](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/904)

## 0.1.1098 - 2026-10-02

### Passengers
- Riders complain about hard braking, fast bends and a jerky foot on the pedals (TooBad_A/B/C
  of the ticket packs), as in OMSI; the third time they get off at the next stop. [#862](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/862) [#873](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/873)
- After the bus was removed, the mouse wheel zooms on foot and the field of view holds. [#837](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/837)

### LAN
- A stop whose waiting people another player's bus took fills up again only once that bus has
  left, instead of a passenger a frame: no more endless streams of riders. [#842](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/842) [#840](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/840) [#830](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/830)
- The chat line opens on the key left of 1 where '/' is the manual gearbox's gear down.

### Graphics
- A compressed smooth dark texture keeps its colour, no longer grainy with green and blue. [#845](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/845)
- A mesh with no matrix or the identity is drawn as wound, as Omsi.exe draws it, so houses
  are no longer shown inside out. [#874](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/874)
- The see-through part of a blended layer shows no reflection (stickers). [#861](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/861)
- A map's WinterSnow textures show their own snow, with no white laid over them. [#879](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/879)
- Falling snow covers the windscreen as rain does, and the wipers clear it. [#883](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/883)
- In Enhanced the map's water is drawn as water: small waves, mirroring the sky. [#841](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/841)
- Street lamps' light map lights the roads as it lights the ground beside them. [#847](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/847)
- Road markings and zebra crossings lie on the road again instead of under it. [#871](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/871)

### Maps
- Objects beside a crossing stand on the ground the map gives them: the terrain is no longer
  pressed into a crossing's height mesh, which Omsi.exe uses for its paths only
  (`OMSI_CROSSING_DEFORM=1` brings the old way back). [#860](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/860)

### Vehicles
- `gear_up` shifts a gear lever past first gear (VW T3, Peugeot 106, Manta), and a force
  feedback wheel that is not set up steers without a dead zone. [#866](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/866)
- An automated manual gearbox (in-game driving settings, off by default). [#713](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/713)
- `A_Trans_*` is taken over OMSI's thirtieth-of-a-second frames, so rattle scripts rattle on
  rough roads at any frame rate. [#772](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/772) [#886](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/886)
- The game menu swaps the driven vehicle for another in its place, or reloads it. [#728](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/728)

### Launcher, menu and input
- "A right click ends the mouse steering" is back in the menu and the launcher. [#878](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/878)
- "The launcher rests while a game runs" is a setting. [#834](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/834)
- Mouse look sensitivity is a setting (100% = OMSI). [#859](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/859)
- Parked cars can be left out altogether (Parked cars: None). [#864](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/864)
- "Indicators cancel themselves" can be switched off. [#451](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/451)
- The touch wheel turns as far as Wheel rotation and Full lock say. [#856](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/856)
- An action can be given another key, and a mod's own trigger can be added to the list. [#854](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/854)
- Any route number can be typed (Route number > Type a route number...). [#836](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/836)
- A gamepad's right stick turns the driver's head. [#454](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/454)
- Buses can be starred in the bus list ("Favourites only"). [#524](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/524)
- On OpenGL a wait for the GPU no longer holds the GL context for seconds (a crash). [#843](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/843)
- On a phone, a crash long after the shaders were compiled is no longer blamed on Vulkan. [#848](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/848)

## 0.1.1068 - 2026-10-02

### Mirrors
- Mirrors are no longer redrawn twice as often as their refresh budget allows.
  [#910](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/910)

## 0.1.1066 - 2026-10-02

### Mirrors
- Mirror reflections have a real-time setting with None, Economical and Full modes.
  [#792](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/792)

## 0.1.1061 - 2026-10-02

### Weather
- Custom weather can be edited from the launcher and in-game, including visibility, wind,
  temperature, humidity, clouds, precipitation, road wetness and snow. METAR ICAO stations
  can be entered directly, the controls are available on mobile too, and LAN clients follow
  a host's custom weather.
  [#789](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/789)

## 0.1.1050 - 2026-10-02

### Vehicles
- Very small resting speeds count as stopped, so systems that require a stationary vehicle,
  including passenger boarding, do not get held up by tiny residual motion.
  [#897](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/897)

## 0.1.1043 - 2026-10-02

### Tests
- Gearbox tests declare their script variables the same way a bus varlist does, including the
  shared-cockpit manual gearbox case.

## 0.1.1042 - 2026-10-02

### Vehicles
- An axle with a fractional `achse_antrieb` share is treated as a driven axle.
  [#892](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/892)

## 0.1.1038 - 2026-10-02

### Camera and controls
- Free-camera fly keys no longer fire OMSI `[game]` actions at the same time.
  [#888](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/888)

## 0.1.1036 - 2026-10-02

### Force feedback
- Road seams no longer kick the steering wheel.
  [#821](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/821)

## 0.1.1028 - 2026-10-02

### Passengers
- People getting off who wait at a shut exit keep to its point; they are no longer lifted up
  inside the bus and stacked there, blocking everyone behind them. [#709](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/709)
- Getting off, passengers head for the nearest open exit, not a shut door, as in OMSI. [#493](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/493)
- `GetHumanCountOnSeat` numbers the seats with the driver's place, as OMSI does (seats were one
  off for scripts).
- The driver no longer stands in a T-pose in the aisle before he is first seated.

### LAN
- Passengers handed over to a client's bus ride to a stop instead of getting off at once. [#813](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/813)
- The chat keys are in the key list (Controls) and can be moved off a key the bus needs. [#130](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/130)

### Traffic and maps
- A junction runs its traffic lights for a lamp without `[trafficlight]`, as Omsi.exe does, so
  mod traffic lights work again and AI cars stop at them. [#822](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/822) [#818](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/818)
- Timetable AI buses pass a stop where nobody gets off or waits, as in OMSI. [#703](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/703)
- An object with traffic paths keeps the height the map gives it (mod road pieces). [#828](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/828)
- A car standing behind a vehicle that waits to move over lets it in (a deadlock). [#414](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/414)
- A `[terrainhole]` cuts the ground along the cutter's rim, so no grass stands over the edges of
  a junction's carriageway. [#823](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/823) [#672](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/672)

### Graphics
- A bus's outer skin below the roof is lit as outside, not as cab: no seam round the body and
  its reflections are back in Enhanced. [#805](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/805)
- `Envir_Brightness` is the night light plus the street lamps' light on the vehicle, so bus glass
  no longer turns clear at night. [#624](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/624)
- Signal lenses follow their `[alphascale]` and `[matl_lightmap]` variables, and scenery objects
  get their light maps. [#826](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/826)

### Vehicles
- The rear section of an articulated bus finds a viaduct's deck again after a gap. [#135](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/135)
- A rear section turns about its own `[rot_pnt_long]` line, so steered rear axles work. [#322](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/322)
- `A_Trans_X/Y/Z` are the body's acceleration without gravity, as in Omsi.exe (`A_Trans_Z` read
  9.81 standing, so air suspension scripts never re-levelled).

### Launcher, menu and input
- The launcher brought forward while a game runs is drawn and answers again. [#825](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/825)
- A long tour no longer makes the Timetable page lose its sidebar. [#666](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/666)
- Save slots: the game menu saves to a new slot, and the launcher continues from any. [#341](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/341)
- A bus deleted from `Mods/installed` is uninstalled (its folder kept in `Mods/uninstalled`). [#819](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/819)
- The exit key of keyboard.cfg (Ctrl+Q) ends the game. [#817](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/817)
- Mouse steering goes on in the map camera (F4), as in OMSI. [#516](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/516)
- The paper timetable's rows are as high as GDI makes them and stay on the paper's lines. [#629](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/629)
- On Linux the new launcher is started after an update, not the old one. [#811](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/811)

## 0.1.1000 - 2026-10-02

### Menu and UI
- Interaction text is hidden when the object cannot actually be reached.
- Loading a graphics profile works from the in-game menu, and 8x MSAA is available there.
- The in-game server code can be copied, cursor flicker is fixed, and menu selection/rendering
  is less distracting.
  [#846](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/846)

## 0.1.983 - 2026-10-02

### Launcher and controls
- A tour can be started from a chosen trip instead of only from the duty's first one.
- Real-time and real-date options keep the launcher's choice on the system clock.
- Controller actions use readable OMSI names, and Alt+Enter switches between a window and
  borderless full screen.
  [#758](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/758)

## 0.1.973 - 2026-10-02

### Driver
- The driver's pose and arms are more natural: the torso sits straighter, shoulders stay
  visible through turns, and both hands remain on the wheel except while shifting.
  [#734](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/734)

## 0.1.968 - 2026-10-02

### Discord
- Discord Rich Presence can show the launcher or the current map, bus, line and tour, and can
  be disabled in Settings.
  [#779](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/779)

## 0.1.965 - 2026-10-02

### Documentation
- The changelog was expanded with 29 issue fixes from the preceding development work.

## 0.1.960 - 2026-10-02

### Passengers
- A stop is no longer a destination of itself or of a stop of the same name, so riders on
  circular lines no longer board and get straight off again. [#795](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/795)
- Riders know their stop by its timetable name as well as by its map label, so they get off
  at intermediate stops where the two names differ, not only at the terminus. [#773](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/773) [#748](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/748) [#736](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/736)

### Traffic and maps
- Cars drive into the end of a road at speed and are taken off there, as in OMSI, instead of
  stopping before it one by one; released AI buses no longer queue at the map's end. [#765](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/765) [#598](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/598)
- The player's bus holds up only traffic on its own level, not cars on a bridge above it. [#753](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/753)
- A depot file's stop list belongs to the trip written before it, as Omsi.exe reads it; a trip
  without a list no longer gives every later route another trip's stops in the IBIS. [#667](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/667)
- On a Chinese, Japanese or Korean Windows, Russian HOF and map text keeps its stop names. [#785](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/785)
- A continued situation resumes at the trip of the tour it was saved on, with the rest of the
  tour, and is saved again with that trip. [#653](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/653)

### Vehicles and input
- Door hit sounds with a `doorSpeed` volume curve are heard: a triggered sound reads its
  volume curves as they stand when the trigger fires (player's and AI buses). [#676](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/676)
- A switch let go with the right button held stays where it is. [#769](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/769)
- On foot, the switches of an articulated bus's rear section are in reach by that section. [#715](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/715)
- A key bound in both [game] and [vehicles] works the vehicle too. [#745](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/745)
- The brake stays on when the mouse steering is switched off. [#517](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/517) [#760](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/760)
- The built-in view keys step aside for keys the player bound themselves. [#701](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/701)
- The city map (Shift+M) and the navigator (Shift+N) open on foot. [#705](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/705)
- The ticket desk camera keeps where it was turned (Home recentres only when unbound). [#733](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/733)
- Head tracking stays on when its UDP port is taken by opentrack. [#775](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/775)

### Launcher
- Dropdown lists scroll by dragging their bar, and sliding an open list no longer scrolls the
  page behind it. [#794](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/794) [#774](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/774)
- Typing into an open dropdown filters it (entry points, buses, fleet numbers). [#747](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/747)
- The game's and the launcher's windows fit the screen and open in its middle. [#771](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/771)

### Graphics
- No rain inside the rear section of articulated buses. [#777](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/777)
- Clouds no longer vanish when a sky texture cannot be read; 24-bit bitfield BMPs load. [#749](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/749)
- The VR headset shows the Enhanced graphics. [#784](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/784)
- Fleet numbers and plates no longer glow in the dark; only text with a light or night map
  does. [#698](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/698)
- The loading screen remakes a Vulkan swapchain that no longer fits instead of freezing. [#776](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/776)

## 0.1.936 - 2026-10-02

### Graphics
- Text textures no longer break up when viewed from a distance.
  [#806](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/806)

## 0.1.929 - 2026-10-02

### VR
- VR navigator settings are restored in the new pause menu
  [#808](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/808)

## 0.1.927 - 2026-10-02

### Menu
- A new in-game menu is implemented, together with real-time and METAR synchronisation.
  [#679](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/679)

### Maps
- Far stand-in models are drawn only from the tiles OMSI loads together with them, so
  stand-ins no longer appear for tiles that are not part of the loaded set.
  [#743](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/743)
- Scenery sign text is aligned correctly again.
  [#764](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/764)

### Input
- Steering wheel hats are read on Linux, and the list scrolls to the pressed button.
  [#788](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/788)

### Physics
- Wheels no longer jolt when driving over stacked road surfaces.
  [#757](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/757)

## 0.1.864 - 2026-10-02

### AI traffic
- Cars simulated out of range take the same routes that an active car on the road would take.
  [#782](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/782)

## 0.1.862 - 2026-10-02

### AI buses
- AI buses can pull into a stop bay immediately after a junction instead of missing it.
  [#737](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/737)

## 0.1.857 - 2026-10-02

### Displays
- Masterbus destination displays work again.
  [#768](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/768)

## 0.1.853 - 2026-10-02

### Graphics
- Vehicle glow bitmaps are no longer upside down and use the same sizing as OMSI 2.
  [#741](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/741)

## 0.1.851 - 2026-10-02

### Maps
- Attached objects (`[attachObj]`) and object labels are read as Omsi.exe reads them. The
  records of a tile depend on its `[version]`: before version 9 there is no detail level
  line, before 6 no IDCodes, before 10 an attached object names its parent by its place in
  the tile instead of its IDCode, before 8 it has no heading, and before 11 a spline has one
  line linking it to the spline before it instead of both neighbours. Older tiles were read
  as version 14 ones, so their objects hung on the wrong parents and pieces of road stood
  in the air. An object's labels are now exactly as many lines as it says (an empty label
  or one in brackets no longer cuts the rest off), an attachment whose parent is written
  after it or that hangs on a later object of a spline attachment row is not loaded, as in
  OMSI.

## 0.1.850 - 2026-10-02

### Launcher
- Big installations no longer show an empty launcher for minutes: the maps appear at once and
  the buses as their folders are read, several folders at a time, with the progress in the
  status line. A poll no longer starts the whole reading over while it runs (the growing cache
  changed the content stamp, so a large OMSI folder never finished loading). Depot files are
  read for their name only, and the search of every vehicle folder for a map's depot runs
  once per session.

### Driving
- Mouse steering stays on: the right button looks round without ending it (also in the
  pause), the cursor goes back to where it steered when the button is let go, and the game
  starts with mouse steering as it was left, the cursor in the middle of the window. OMSI's
  right click that ends mouse steering is a setting (Esc > Options > "A right click ends the
  mouse steering").
- Door keys of UK buses: on Road-hog123's door script (London Citybus 400, Enviro400s and
  many more) `bus_doorfront0` opens the door and `bus_doorfront1` closes it, and Shift+1 fired
  both, so the door never opened. Door key triggers are now tried on the scripts first, and
  when they undo each other only the one that moves the door is fired.

### People
- Passengers get off double-deckers again: the once-a-second check for another open door ran
  every frame, pulling everyone back to the nearest path point, so people coming down from
  the upper deck stayed on the stairs. People held up face to face in the aisle or on the
  stairs squeeze past after two seconds.
- Passengers paying at the cash desk hold the money out to the tray instead of raising the
  arm up and forward: the arm's reach had its lift and turn the wrong way round.
- Standing passengers keep their feet on the ground at every tick, as Omsi.exe does, not at
  the height of their waiting place's object.
- A long bus station stop gets the waiting places of objects along its whole length.

### Performance
- People standing still are not skinned and uploaded again every frame (2.6 ms to 0.15 ms a
  frame for thirty waiting passengers).
- `OMSI_PROFILE` lists triangles per asset and names the stages of slow people ticks;
  `OMSI_SKIP_PIPE` and `OMSI_CHECK_GROUND` help measuring.

### Merged pull requests
- #661 shadow blobs lie on the road under a bridge, and can be switched off; #696 glass found
  by its texture's alpha (lamps show through every bus's windows); #699 "The game is running"
  in the launcher; #704, #687, #689, #675, #688 dedicated server administration (`tell`,
  weather by name, `/status` weather and clock, `POST /admin` from the same machine - refused
  through a tunnel or proxy); #706, #710 outside camera; #707 16x anisotropic filtering;
  #711 8x MSAA; #708 a Windows test; #714 changelog.

## 0.1.810 - 2026-10-02

### Launcher
- Buttons that contain only an icon now centre it correctly instead of leaving the spacing
  reserved for a missing label; this fixes the livery arrows on Drive > Bus and the mobile
  file browser's folder-up button (#678).

## 0.1.808 - 2026-10-02

### Traffic
- Traffic-light programs that use conditional backwards jumps to extend a phase no longer
  repeat the same jump indefinitely and get stuck on one signal combination. The extension
  is replayed once before the normal cycle continues (#692).

### VR
- VR has an adjustable cockpit navigator attached to the bus. It can be moved and rotated,
  its distance and size can be adjusted, and position, rotation, size, opacity and visibility
  are saved separately for each bus (#693).
- `Ctrl+Shift+M` enters navigator placement mode and `Ctrl+Shift+N` shows or hides it; both
  actions can be rebound. The same placement settings are available in the VR options menu
  (#693).
- The VR pause menu is smaller for a more comfortable fit (#693).

## 0.1.800 - 2026-10-02

### Server
- A dedicated server can optionally expose `GET /players` for live web maps. The JSON list
  contains each player's name, bus, line, destination, tour, position, heading and speed,
  and latitude/longitude on maps with `[worldcoordinates]` (#674).
- Player position sharing is off by default and must be enabled with `share_positions = 1`
  in `server.cfg`; otherwise `/players` returns 404 (#674).
- A player on foot is reported at the walker's position, and the walker is preferred over
  a parked bus when both exist (#674).

## 0.1.796 - 2026-10-01

### Graphics
- Enhanced graphics can reflect buses, buildings and scenery in wet-road puddles. Reflections
  follow the local road height, slope and camber, and nearby articulated bus sections are
  included (#686).
- Puddle reflections use bounded half-resolution screen-space rendering and are skipped on
  dry roads, full snow, mirror views, OpenGL and when reflections are disabled, limiting
  their cost when they are not needed (#686).

## 0.1.791 - 2026-10-01

### Controls
- DirectInput now finds generic controllers and button boxes with no axes, including custom
  Arduino, Pro Micro and STM32 devices, instead of silently leaving them disconnected.
  Keyboards, mice and screen pointers remain filtered out (#71, #662).
- Holding both opposite steering keys keeps the wheel at its current position, as in OMSI,
  instead of always giving the left key priority. Releasing either key immediately continues
  steering in the remaining direction (#663).
- `Toggle game controllers` follows its configured key binding instead of also having a
  hard-coded `K`. Leaving the action unbound now frees `K`, and rebinding it to another key
  works as expected (#649, #670).

## 0.1.785 - 2026-10-01

### Multiplayer
- In LAN multiplayer, a client's bus can take the host's waiting passengers again. They are
  claimed from the stop where the client's bus is listed and handed over as that client's
  waiting passengers.

### Project
- Repository, updater, website, documentation and release links now use the project's new
  `openOMSI-Project/openOMSI` home after the repository moved to the openOMSI-Project
  organization.

## 0.1.782 - 2026-10-01

### People
- Passengers are rewritten after Omsi.exe: the same tasks (waiting, the bus coming,
  walking to the bus, to a place, to the exit, sitting), waiting places along the stop's
  platform by its length and side, a bus taken from 60 m out and only when its terminus
  is one of theirs, the nearest open door (or one with a button), the cabin's path network
  walked by its own routing tables, a free place reserved at random (none free: they stay
  behind), the ticket stamped or bought at the desk with the game's dialogue, and everybody
  out at the terminus. The made-up queues, door waits and aisle shuffling are gone: people
  no longer stand at a door for long or crowd into the bus.
- Passengers and people on foot are posed and animated as in OMSI (its joint angles, gait
  curves, stride and stoop) instead of with leg IK. Pedestrians on the pavements stay as
  they were.
- Timetable buses no longer set off with a made-up number of riders by the hour.

## 0.1.780 - 2026-10-01

### Controls
- The left and right turn signals can be toggled by keys or wheel buttons (automatic
  cancelling still applies), and the driver's view can follow the steering with an
  adjustable angle and response (#657, #646).

## 0.1.774 - 2026-10-01

### Vehicles
- `GetTTTerminusIndex` answers the depot terminus named like the trip's terminus (or -1),
  as OMSI does: the IBIS's automatic destination showed a wrong or random terminus (#623,
  #545). Switching to free drive clears the bus's timetable values (#623).
- The cab's paper timetable is OMSI's: one Courier New text, the stop names cut or dotted to
  25 characters, 24 rows a column, one time a stop and the arrival/departure words of the
  game's language instead of German everywhere (#629).

### Controls
- The combined throttle/brake axis puts the throttle on the right half, as OMSI does (#577).
- A vJoy device no longer crashes the game when vibration starts (#655).

### People
- People on foot step only onto surfaces up to 0.5 m higher, as in OMSI, and no longer onto
  low roofs or benches (#600).
- Busy stops no longer drop the frame rate (#656).

### Traffic
- A map's own AI cars load when their `.ovh` leaves the registration affixes out (#644).

## 0.1.759 - 2026-10-01

### Traffic
- AI vehicles switch their lights on below OMSI's light value of 0.75, before the street
  lamps, and keep them on after the lamps go out (#620).
- The street lamps come on below a light value of 0.6 as in OMSI, and each scenery object's
  `NightlightA` at its own threshold (a random 0.3-0.75 with `[NightMapMode]`) (#620).
- A timetable bus at the end of its tour's last trip leaves the road at once instead of
  driving on and queueing at the map's end (#598, #536).
- The amount of street traffic follows the paths' `trafficdensity`; density-0 and no-car
  paths stay empty (#625, #161).
- Fewer stutters when AI vehicles appear (#641).

### Controls
- Looking round in a view of the bus follows the cursor and scales with the field of view, as
  in OMSI (#622, #398); the cursor shows up-down arrows while zooming (#621).
- Force feedback direction is detected and saved per wheel (#637).

### Graphics
- The scene shader compiles on OpenGL and GLES again (black screen and crashes on some
  Android and Linux machines, #617, #610, #556, #456).
- A model takes the ambient light with OMSI's white material ambient (or its
  `[matl_allcolor]`), not its diffuse colour (#530).
- Coloured lamp sprites are blended as OMSI blends them and keep their colour (#601).

### Interface
- IBIS picks the route by the trip's stops (#631); the information bar (Ctrl+Y) shows the
  passengers aboard (#628).

### Multiplayer
- A server seeds bus-stop passengers near every player (#626).

## 0.1.737 - 2026-10-01

### Sound
- A triggered sound keeps its loudest volume while it plays, as in OMSI: door sounds are no
  longer cut off when the door stops moving (#473, #611, #542).

### Passengers
- A passenger's stop request fires `int_haltewunsch` as in OMSI, not the cab's stop button
  triggers, which played the driver's switch and brake sounds on some buses (#569).

### Traffic
- The map's path rules `bus` and `trucks` open a path to AI buses and trucks by their
  `ai_veh_type`, as in OMSI: trucks no longer avoid exactly the roads marked for them, and
  bus roads are no longer closed to cars (#612).

### Graphics
- Every camera clips at 0.1 m as in OMSI: a wide field of view no longer cuts into the cab
  (#587).
- A light's sprite keeps its own colours, tinted by the light's colour (#601).
- `STLoadTex`/`STNewTex` size a script texture as D3DX does (the bitmap's power of two,
  stretched), and a resized one no longer keeps the old picture's memory (#607).
- A weather chosen from the menu comes at once, as in OMSI, and the clouds drift on smoothly
  while a weather blends in (#609).

### Controls
- Gamepad triggers on Windows are no longer read as buttons, and the D-pad works (#602).

### On foot
- The ground is the floor at the walker's level, not a stop's roof over it (#600).

### Launcher
- No "missing pack" for a part the game finds from the vehicle's own folders (#582).
- The pause notice appears once and is translated (#616).

## 0.1.721 - 2026-10-01

Pull requests from the community: #455, #560, #563, #566, #570, #580, #583, #585, #588,
#591, #592, #594, #597, #599, #604, #605, #608.

### Traffic
- AI cars no longer wait at junctions without traffic lights for no reason (#591).
- AI buses at a stop on the left open their left doors (#592).

### Controls
- Force feedback fixes and improvements (#585); manual gear buttons can be held, letting go
  returns to neutral (#570).

### Launcher
- Mods can be imported from .7z and RAR archives as well (#570).
- Better vehicle selection with a livery preview (#583); the fleet number is set before the
  bus starts up (#560).
- The launcher gives its graphics device up while a game runs (#599).

### Interface
- Interior and exterior temperatures in the HUD and the navigator (#605), stop requests on the
  minimap (#604), better roads and stop markers in the navigator (#563).
- Route numbers that start with a letter (X10, M48, N9) on the destination display (#588).

### Graphics
- Scripted LED traffic lamps get their materials, and a same-name DDS texture is preferred
  (#566); `[matl_freetex]` paths relative to the OMSI folder work (#580).
- VR: the mirrors can refresh faster, up to every frame (#608).

### Passengers
- A map's `humans.txt` may name people in nested pack folders (#455).

### Fixes
- On foot: walking stays on the bus's right level (#594); a dedicated server updates the
  passenger density and the time of day every tick (#597).

## 0.1.623 - 2026-10-01

### Passengers
- Passengers see the doors open on buses whose script sets `PAX_Entry`/`PAX_Exit` without
  listing them in its varlist (stock MAN NL, MAN NLC, many Citaros), and on 3-door buses the
  middle and rear doors let people out again; `door<i>` without the underscore works too
  (#532, #535, #512, #537, #179, from #551).
- They walk to the nearest open door or one with a request button, as OMSI does, and switch
  when the driver opens a nearer one, instead of all crowding the front door (#535).
- Waiting at a door that is still shut, they press the request and stay, and the bus
  creeping a metre or two to line up no longer sends them back to the shelter (#532, #512).

### Controls
- With the default keys plain Left/Right switch the interior camera as in OMSI (A/D steer;
  the "Arrow keys only" preset still steers with them), and the camera keys go on into the
  rear section's driver cameras of an articulated bus (#519, #525, #464).
- The viewpoint key steps through the driver, passenger, outside and map views as in OMSI
  (#519).
- Wheels: the scripts' shaking (`FF_Vib_Amp`, `FF_Vib_Period`) plays as a real periodic
  force-feedback effect (#501).
- Head tracking on Windows also reads opentrack's freetrack output (TrackIR protocol) (#522).

### Launcher
- The fleet number can be picked from the bus's number list before driving (also in a duty
  and with `--number`), as in OMSI's vehicle dialog (#538, #133).

### Graphics
- A `[matl_lightmap]` on a variable the bus does not have is always lit, as in OMSI, not
  always dark (dashboard lamps, #475, #352, #231).
- Painted ground no longer darkens through stacked layers at shallow angles, and painted
  edges no longer shift with the texture's mip level (#552).

### Maps
- `[surface]` objects stand on the terrain like every other object without `[absheight]`,
  as in OMSI (#531, #453, #460, #417).
- Stairs and excavations of presurface objects are no longer filled by the terrain (#526),
  and declared `[terrainhole]`s cut railway cuttings and underpasses however deep (#550).
- Terrain-mapped textures of a map's own folder win over global seasonal copies (#548).
- On a Windows with a Chinese, Japanese or Korean code page, content text is read in that
  code page, as OMSI does.

### Traffic
- Random AI cars at a dead end or the map edge leave at once, as in OMSI, instead of standing
  there and blocking the cars behind (#536, #327).

## 0.1.592 - 2026-10-01

### Passengers
- People getting off wait at the exit they chose when they pressed the stop button, as in
  OMSI, instead of running to whichever door opens first, usually the front one (#493, #336).
- As many people wait at a stop as the map's passenger counts for it and the passengers
  setting give, up to its waiting places, as in OMSI. Before, never more than seven: 200%
  changed nothing (#458, from #513).

### Controls
- Game controller axes use their characteristic from gamectrler.cfg (progressive,
  degressive, bi-..., range extension), as in OMSI; the launcher's controller page sets it.
  Before, a G25 set to bi-progressive steered linearly (#479).
- Plain Left/Right switch the interior camera again unless a wheel steers (#464, #519).
- The hints for a bus that does not move name the player's own keys (#461).
- P pauses and resumes without opening the menu; a LAN session cannot be paused (#527).

### Graphics
- Sun shadows stay until the sun is about a degree below the horizon, as in OMSI (they went
  at 4.6°), and overcast weather or fog under 350 m casts none (#518, #506).
- Route arrows cast no shadow (#508).
- Scenery text textures (street signs) are lit like their object and no longer glow at night
  (#470).

### Fixes
- A crash in the interface's texture cleanup (#534).

## 0.1.576 - 2026-10-01

### Passengers
- People no longer freeze at an open door before boarding (#498).
- Buses whose scripts set `PAX_Entry0_Open` for the front door only (the SD200, SD202) let
  people out of the rear doors again: an exit without a `PAX_Exit` variable follows its
  `door_<i>` (#486).

### Controls
- Steering wheels (G27, G29, Driving Force GT...): the pedals no longer act as buttons and
  buttons no longer fire twice (#480).
- The weather's METAR airport can be typed as an ICAO code (#492).

### Interface
- In-game interface size and opacity, and the notes in the corner, are settings; sharper
  text; the pause menu's Options list one line a setting (#446).
- The in-cab schedule sheet shows the player's timetable (#491).
- AI-only lines are no longer offered for driving (#483).

### Graphics
- LED panels: a "LED mip strength" slider (0-4) instead of the on/off switch (#490).
- Dashboard lamps built as `[visible]` meshes with a plain `[matl_nightmap]` light up by
  day as well, as in OMSI (#507).
- `[terrainmapping]` takes the map's first ground texture only, as Omsi.exe does; ground
  lighting and tile seams fixed (#436).
- VR: the bus mirrors are no longer black when looking round (#487).
- The driver figure's arms and the hand on a manual gear lever (#465).

### Maps
- Surface objects modelled away from their origin (bridges) stand at the road's height
  (#496); scenery `[matl_freetex]` works without a script (#474).

### Traffic
- AI cyclists ride at 15-21 km/h and no longer show green boxes on the rider (#502).

## 0.1.538 - 2026-10-01

### Graphics
- Enhanced: flipdot destination displays (the stock MAN NL/NG Krueger matrix, the flipdot
  variants of the NEOMAN and Sprinter mods), whose light map is a picture of their dots, no
  longer glow and bloom like LED panels. LED panels (a plain white light map) still glow,
  and go dark when the bus's power or lights are switched off (#413).
- Enhanced: the mirrors are no longer far darker than the view through the windscreen at
  dusk and in daytime rain; they dim only once the sun is below the horizon (#432).
- The driver figure is lit by the four interior lamps of its seat, as OMSI lights a seated
  person - coloured, by distance and from the lamp's side - instead of a flat glow of every
  lamp in the bus that left it overexposed (#206).
- `[matl_texadress_mirror]` and `[matl_texadress_mirroronce]` mirror the textures beyond
  their edges as in OMSI, instead of smearing the edge (#145).
- A TGA picture under a `.png`, `.bmp` or `.jpg` name is read by its content, as OMSI does;
  it used to leave the slot without a texture (#414).

### Maps
- A tile has water only when its `.map` says `[water]`: a leftover `.water` file no longer
  floods a tile whose water was removed (#414).

### Controls
- New setting "Dynamic steering" (Driving tab), OMSI's `redSteerSpd`: the steering keys and
  the wheel's return to centre slow down with speed (#347).
- Camera tab: "Right mouse button turns the view" switched off gives OMSI's own mouse: the
  right button zooms (up widens the cab view, backs the outside camera away) and the wheel
  button turns the view. On (the default) right-drag looks round as before and Shift+right
  zooms (#398, #104).

### Sound
- Passenger footsteps in a bus use the step sounds its `paths.cfg` gives each walkway: on the
  SD200 the stairs sound like stairs and the upper deck has its own floor. Before, every
  step picked from all of OMSI's floor samples (#311).
- The bus's outside sounds (the SD200's exterior engine) are heard from the cab through an
  open door or window, at the level the bus script gives (`Snd_OutsideVol`), as in OMSI.
- The cab no longer plays a made-up low engine rumble under the bus's own sounds: OMSI makes
  no vehicle sound of its own.

### People
- `[walk_param]` is read as OMSI reads it (stride, then arm angle), and people walk at OMSI's
  1.1 m/s ± 0.2: the stride was taken for a speed (#393).

### Vehicles
- Script callbacks round their arguments to the nearest whole number as OMSI does, instead of
  cutting them off: a terminus code of 1100.9999 out of a script's arithmetic now finds
  terminus 1101, not 1100 (#312, #197).

## 0.1.523 - 2026-10-01

### Controls
- In mouse steering the cursor sets the pedals every frame, as in OMSI: a brake held on the
  keyboard (with "The keyboard brake stays on until the throttle") no longer stays on under
  the mouse (#395).
- Letting go of a key fires only that key's own `_off` trigger, as in Omsi.exe. On some mods
  it fired an alias's release (e.g. `parking_brake_mouse_off`, `kw_blinker_*_off`), which
  undid the parking brake or the turn signal just set with the keyboard (#420).
- The hand cursor appears over every clickable part of the cockpit, including large ones
  such as door leaves, the cockpit door and the steering column (#411).

### Vehicles
- Articulated buses: the rear section stops at the joint's maximum angle from
  `[coupling_front_character]` (52.5° on the GN92) instead of folding through the front
  section when turning tightly or reversing (#410).
- The odometer starts at a used bus's reading, as in OMSI: from the year and the km a year
  in `[kmcounter_init]` (1980 and 60000 when a bus has none), ±20% from bus to bus. Before,
  such buses showed 000000; reversing now also takes the counter back (#305).
- Number plates: a repaint's own `[registration_list]` plate is used for AI buses whatever
  the template says afterwards; the player's bus takes it as the vehicle dialog does. Before,
  they showed the automatic prefix and the fleet number (#133).
- The passenger cameras of an articulated bus's rear section hang on its body like the
  front section's: `[add_camera_pax]` distance, pitch and roll (#174, #126).
- `[matl_change]`: the first `[matl_item]` is made of its own block only, no longer of the
  later items' maps (an LED matrix showed its script texture at value 1) (#210).
- A `[matl_freetex]` declared inside a `[matl_item]` changes the powered material only, and
  named material references in `.x` models are resolved (from #436).

### Maps
- Crossings draped over the ground (`[crossing_heightdeformation]`) get normals rebuilt from
  their faces, as Omsi.exe does: some junctions looked as if their faces were turned
  inside out (#428).

### Sound
- `[important]` sounds keep their place when more sounds play than OMSI's
  `[sound_maxcount]` of 200 (#434).

### Graphics
- Mirrors can be switched off (Settings, Graphics, Mirrors: Off) on slower machines (#433).

### Multiplayer
- Numpad ÷ opens the front door again instead of the chat line (#130).

### Modding
- HTML pages: `omsi.getDepartures(stop)` lists the next departures of a stop, and
  `omsi.setNextStop(index)` can also go back to an earlier stop (#437).

### Android
- The content folders and the OMSI 2 installation get a `.nomedia` file, so the gallery no
  longer lists thousands of textures as photos - the media scan kept phones busy and people
  deleted the "pictures", leaving buses white (#443).

## 0.1.486 - 2026-10-01

### Launcher
- The Settings page is split into six tabs - Graphics, Driving, Camera, Sound, Gameplay,
  General - each fitting the window, instead of about ninety controls in three long
  columns; on a phone too (#430).

## 0.1.483 - 2026-10-01

### Graphics
- PBR maps (`_nn`, `_rr`, `_ao`, ...) work on map textures: roads, splines and scenery
  objects were drawn flat - only the textures loaded on the spot got their maps, not the
  ones a tile's preparation brought, which are nearly all of a map's. Maps put into the
  same folder in the openOMSI content folder, beside a texture of the OMSI install, are
  found too.

## 0.1.481 - 2026-10-01

### Controls
- Holding both mouse buttons and moving the mouse zooms as in OMSI (its "M_Zoom"): up
  zooms in on the dashboard, down back out to the seat's view; outside, the camera moves
  further away or closer. It did nothing - the right button only looked round.
- Pressing the right button while a switch or lever is held with the left one no longer
  turns the view and stops the drag.

## 0.1.479 - 2026-10-01

### Maps
- Objects placed along a spline that follow its slope and cant (railings, posts, signs,
  lights) turn within the spline's inclined surface: one turned sideways to the road no
  longer leans across it and off the ground on a sloped or canted street, and one on a
  chain running backwards no longer tips downhill (from #409).

### Android
- No "fs_blur" shader error on OpenGL devices: the ambient occlusion pipelines, which
  OpenGL ES cannot compile, are left out there - AO stays available on Vulkan (#422).

## 0.1.476 - 2026-10-01

### Controls
- Mouse steering sensitivity can be set in the pause menu's Options (Mouse steering
  sensitivity + / -, 10% to 300%; 100% is OMSI's), and the launcher's slider goes as far.
- The log says how each game controller came in (its layout, DirectInput or the system's)
  and, the first time a stick or axis moves, whether it steers - for reports of sticks
  that do nothing.

### Windows
- The game and the dedicated server start on a PC without the Visual C++ Redistributable:
  its runtime DLLs ship beside `openomsi.exe` ("The code execution cannot proceed because
  VCRUNTIME140_1.dll was not found").

## 0.1.471 - 2026-10-01

### Physics
- Buses no longer fall through the road at junctions over a buried embankment slope
  (Cotterell, the junction by the park): a road face lying more than a metre under the
  drawn ground beneath the wheel is no road there, and the bus stands on the ground, as
  with Omsi.exe's highest-face query (#424, #423).
- The wheels roll on the road where it is drawn: splines and `[surface]` objects are drawn
  8 cm over their authored height and the bus now stands on them there, not 8 cm into
  the asphalt (#421).

### Maps
- An object stored in a neighbouring tile's file, past its own tile's edge, stands on the
  ground under it instead of the height at its tile's border (#421).

## 0.1.463 - 2026-10-01

### Passengers
- With the door release on, the SD200's automatic rear door no longer opens on its own
  while riders board at the front: riders no longer press the outside door opener, which
  Omsi.exe never does - they only ask for a door through `PAX_Entry<n>_Req` (#416, #415).

### Project
- Pull requests get a template, and ones opened from a `main` branch or an organisation
  account are closed with a note (#418).

## 0.1.455 - 2026-10-01

### Traffic
- Emergency vehicles have right of way at crossings: a vehicle whose script sets
  `TrafficPriority` goes before the others and they give way to it, as Omsi.exe does for
  any vehicle, not only the player's bus (#356).
- Timetable buses stop at the stop on their own side of the road: on a route back along
  the same street, they stopped at the stop across the road on the way out. Stops are
  matched in the trip's order, on the lane they stand beside.

### Graphics
- Enhanced: the far road and ground no longer go dark at grazing angles - what reflects
  nothing keeps its light, and a wet road reflects the sky (#374).

### Graphics cards
- Cards of up to 4 GB use the allocator's small memory blocks, and a texture budget larger
  than the card holds is taken down to its size: 2 GB cards lost their device to "out of
  memory" in the first frames (#332, #295, #323).

## 0.1.451 - 2026-10-01

### Vehicles
- Wheels stay under their hub caps: the drawn tyres are seated on the physical hub at the
  point they turn about (the rotation's `origin_trans`), not at the .o3d's own pivot. A tyre
  without a pivot (the NEOMAN's right front) was measured at a point circling the hub and
  moved up and down by centimetres as it turned, so its cap seemed to roll off it.

### View
- Smooth camera transitions when changing and entering views, a setting in the pause menu
  as well (#408, by shloooo).

### Graphics (Vanilla, at night)
- The map's lamps leave `[tree]`s dark, as in OMSI 2 (#407, by Sulamufor).
- The terrain's light map lights the ground instead of glowing over it (#406, by Sulamufor).

## 0.1.438 - 2026-10-01

### View
- The driver's hands in the cab view are a setting now (Settings and the pause Options,
  "Driver's hands in the cab view"), off by default.

### Graphics
- Vanilla: reflections blend in gamma like the rest of the classic picture; at night the
  MAN NL/NG instrument glass no longer lies milky white over the unlit gauges (#401, by
  Sulamufor).

## 0.1.434 - 2026-10-01

### Driving
- An automatic gearbox is no longer taken for a manual one. A bus counted as manual when
  its scripts answered to the gate keys (`kw_s_1`, `kw_s_2`) and read a `Clutch` anywhere -
  many automatics do both (gear hold keys, a torque converter's own clutch) - and the
  automatic clutch of the settings then worked their clutch at every stop and pull-away,
  and the phone showed a manual's gate. Now a gearbox is manual when it has the gates and
  no automatic's `automatic_D`, or when its first gate itself asks for the clutch, or when
  it works a clutch of its own through `AutoClutch` (checked on the LiAZ MKPP/GMP, the
  Sprinter G32/G-tronic, the SD202 and the NEOMAN A23).

## 0.1.433 - 2026-10-01

### Graphics
- Enhanced graphics are there again on every device and graphics API (0.1.402 left them
  out on phones and OpenGL). They are built whenever Enhanced is chosen; only a phone or
  OpenGL device not set to Enhanced skips compiling them, as it never draws them - that
  compile is what killed Mali and Adreno drivers at the start.

### Driving and view
- Scripts: a trigger starts with 1 on its stack, as in OMSI - a trigger guarded by a bare
  `{if}` did nothing (the S315 UL-GT's ticket printer switch) (#388, by hannsadrian).
- The interior camera glides between viewpoints (OMSI's `driverview_smooth`, a setting)
  (#388).
- The driver's hands are seen in the cab view, the rest of the figure folded away (#376, by
  Neblina666).

### Displays and translations
- The Atron ticket machine shows its stop text and keeps its sales screen (#390, by
  TruckiHD).
- Brazilian Portuguese improved, European Portuguese added (#396, by isaacsa2).

## 0.1.402 - 2026-09-30

### Graphics
- Rain on the windows: drops no longer run down in lanes of wavy lines all at once. Now and
  then a single drop breaks loose, slides a few centimetres to a hand's width in jerks,
  nearly straight with a little drift, and stops again - each at its own moment.

### Vehicles (compared with Omsi.exe)
- A `[matl_change]` with several `[matl_item]`s shows item n at value n, as Omsi.exe does:
  only the first was kept and shown at 1, so e.g. the MAN New Lion's City's door buttons
  (2 = lit while the door is open) stayed dark (#352).
- `[animparent]` hangs a mesh on the last mesh before it that carries the name, as Omsi.exe
  resolves it while reading: door variants reusing their arms' names moved the later
  variant's leaves with the first one's arm (Solaris Urbino III "Bode new", #348).
- Station displays and other scenery text show a string that arrives after their first
  frame (they were only redrawn on `Refresh_Strings`, #367).

### Driving
- A throttle pedal takes off a brake the keyboard holds, as the throttle key does: the
  bus was driven against its brakes (#377).

### Traffic
- Cars change only onto lanes open to their own traffic group: trucks no longer take the
  cycle paths beside a road (#327); trucks keep to the speed limit (up to 80-90 km/h, it was
  38-47 on every road), bicycles ride at 20-28 km/h.
- In multiplayer the host has traffic round itself again (#342).

### Phones and crash reports
- Phones and OpenGL leave out the Enhanced graphics' pipelines: they are never drawn there,
  and compiling the ray-marched clouds' sky killed Mali and Adreno drivers before the first
  frame (#364, #333, #316, #371).
- A crash report takes its title from the run itself: an error before the game started, or
  one the game got over, titled reports of games that died much later (#381, #331).

## 0.1.400 - 2026-09-30

### Performance
- Macs and phones: a fixed render scale keeps to the same pixel budget as the automatic
  one on high-resolution screens, the navigator draws without multisampling, the picture's
  depth is not written back where nothing reads it, and two frames are in flight so the
  graphics chip works while the next frame is prepared (M1 Pro, Thüringer Wald: 20 to 57
  fps; one frame more of input delay with V-sync) (#385, by hannsadrian).
- Linux builds link with lld (#384, by no-felix).

## 0.1.394 - 2026-09-30

### Graphics
- Rain drops on the windows are smaller again (the big ones of 0.1.381 were far too big and
  lumpy), and a drop running down leaves only a cleared track and a few beads - no more
  thin tail drawn behind it.

### Driving
- A clutch pedal pushed to the floor is fully in: a wheel's pedal reads 0.93-0.99 there, and
  the LiAZ/PAZ gearboxes part the engine from the wheels only above 0.95 and take a gear only
  at 1 - holding the clutch at a stop still stalled the engine. All pedals' last few per
  cent count as their ends; the phone's clutch is in from three quarters down.

### Passengers
- Riders who stood up as the bus pulled in get off at their stop: they lost "this is my
  stop" as the bus came to a stand and stayed at the door (#336).
- Riders of timetable buses no longer lose their stop whenever the player's bus stops
  somewhere (#317); somebody held off the exit by a pole gets off from there.

### Controllers and launcher
- Controller buttons can pause, take a screenshot, quicksave and switch mouse steering or the
  controllers (#380, by isaacsa2); DirectInput devices with unusual layouts (button boxes
  without axes) are taken (#379, by isaacsa2).
- Text fields in the launcher can be clicked into, selected and overwritten (#373, by XiZyno).
- The dedicated server starts on machines without a graphics card again (#375, by no-felix;
  #368).
- Translations completed and corrected, Traditional Chinese in full (#383, by EFour4).

## 0.1.381 - 2026-09-30

### Graphics
- Rain on the bus windows looks like real drops, in all three graphics modes (Vanilla had
  OMSI's sliding texture until now):
  - every drop is a lens: it shows the street behind the glass through itself, small and
    upside down, with the sky at its bottom (from the last frame's picture);
  - drops come in four sizes up to over a centimetre, with uneven rims, the heavy ones
    drawn out downwards, and clear glass between them;
  - a runner leaves a thin stream of water in its track;
  - while the bus drives, the airstream takes the runners up and out across the windscreen
    and back along the side windows, harder the faster it goes.
  It costs about half a millisecond at 1080p.

## 0.1.380 - 2026-09-30

### Game menu
- The pause menu's Options are kept: most switches (collisions, camera collisions, view
  turning with the steering, force feedback, keyboard brake hold, automatic clutch, head
  tracking) were written in a form the settings file read as "not set" and came back at
  their defaults, and LED glow and LED mipmaps were not saved at all.
- The launcher takes over the settings a game changed instead of writing its older copy back
  over them when it saved something of its own.

### Passengers
- Somebody at the front of a queue whom a railing, pole or shelter wall holds off the door
  boards from where they stand; they stood a metre from the open door until the bus left.

## 0.1.378 - 2026-09-30

### Performance
- Busy maps run much faster: the frame's render preparation (culling, shadow casters, draw
  lists, bundle recording) is spread over the render threads instead of one core, mirrors
  are drawn only when in view and at most 30 times a second, the navigator's map is redrawn
  at most 30 times a second, and the cab's hover pick tests only the triangles near the
  cursor. On St-Servan with traffic and passengers: 37 to 60 fps (#369, by ThiBot77).

### Website
- Download: the "Your system" badge no longer breaks across the card title, and the
  Download buttons line up.

## 0.1.374 - 2026-09-30

### Graphics
- Vanilla lights textures through the sRGB curve instead of a plain power of 2.2, so dark
  colours are no longer crushed (#343, by Sulamufor).
- Small dashboard indicator lights are drawn again instead of being dropped as too small
  (#346, by no-felix).

### Driving
- Turning the wheel can turn the driver's view into the bend, as in OMSI's "look with the
  steering wheel" (#363, by shloooo).
- AI emergency vehicles sound their siren when something holds them up (#357, by Sulamufor).
- System gamepads on Windows can have their buttons bound again (#358, by EpixIXIx).

### Game and launcher
- The game menu's scrollbar can be dragged (#354, by XiZyno).
- When the game was closed by the system (out of memory), the launcher says so and points
  to the settings that help (#355, by no-felix).
- A saved situation keeps each vehicle's livery; read-only content folders fall back to a
  writable place (#365, by no-felix).

### Multiplayer
- LAN protocol 6: a vehicle's state carries up to 63 values, the rear section's sounds and
  what is seen first come first, and INFO messages are sent at most four times a second
  (#353, with the updated #338 and #334, by Jaja80330). Players and servers need this
  version together.

### Displays
- A character a font lacks is left out, as Omsi.exe does (its glyph lookup gives none),
  instead of being drawn as the font's first glyph; spaces keep their width. The MAN Lion's
  City's odometer and trip meter lose the `|` in front of them (#370, by no-felix; #360).

### Website
- Download: the Windows button downloaded the dedicated server (its zip ends the same way).
  Every build now has its own button - Windows and Windows on ARM, macOS for Apple silicon
  and Intel, Linux and Linux on ARM, Android - the one for your system first, and the four
  dedicated servers apart below. Installing on macOS is explained too.

## 0.1.371 - 2026-09-30

### Website
- Every build has its own download button instead of matching files only by the end of their
  names. Windows ARM64, macOS Intel, Linux ARM64 and the dedicated-server builds are listed,
  the visitor's platform is shown first, and macOS installation is explained.

## 0.1.344 - 2026-09-30

### Driving
- Braking and pulling away pitch the bus as much as in OMSI (the tyres' forces act about
  the hubs), and it no longer pitches at a standstill.
- Turning the wheel no longer kicks the body into a roll: while the tyres hold, the bus
  leans only by the bend's pull, as Omsi.exe does.
- A wheel in the air stays where it hangs at rest (`Axle_Suspension`), as in OMSI.

## 0.1.342 - 2026-09-30

### Performance
- Busy spline scenes cost far less CPU: short static kerb, grass and pavement splines are
  drawn together per 48 m cell, and `[terrainmapping]` spline faces share the tile's ground
  materials (#340, by TruckiHD; for #284).

### Multiplayer
- Another player's articulated bus has its rear section lit, with its displays and its
  sounds (#338); its roller blind shows the line number (#334); a passenger in another
  player's bus hears it from inside (#330) - all by Jaja80330. The network format changed
  with #334: players and servers need this version together.

## 0.1.330 - 2026-09-30

### Driving
- The driver's and the passengers' views ride with the bus: their cameras hang on the body
  as Omsi.exe's do, pitching under braking and leaning in bends with the cab, the mouse
  look turned in the bus's frame. The level view with the cab rocking about it was most of
  the "boat" - the body's own heave, pitch and roll already settle as Omsi.exe's do.
- Mods with physics of their own: `Brakeforce` and every `Axle_Brakeforce_*` go back to 0
  after the physics read them, as Omsi.exe clears them each frame before the scripts run -
  a script that brakes only now and then (a retarder, a stop brake, custom physics) no
  longer leaves the brakes on for good.

### Traffic
- Timetable buses pull into the bay: they move over to the `[busstop]` box as Omsi.exe
  moves them - the kerb-side flank 0.3 m past the box's centre, from the stop's docking
  distance (30 m) out - whether or not a path leads into the bay (#241).

## 0.1.328 - 2026-09-30

### Vehicles
- The wheels stand on the road: the suspension's spring point is where Omsi.exe puts it,
  on the model's origin plane under each wheel, measured straight up. Measured from the hub
  less the `.bus` file's tyre radius, a mod whose tyre mesh is larger than that stood with
  its wheels sunk a few centimetres into the spline.

### Pictures
- Enhanced: chrome and metal parts of a vehicle - opaque, with a sphere map, not the body -
  are metal by their `[matl_envmap]` factor, as the vanilla picture shows them; their bump
  maps bend the reflection. The body stays paint unless it has a mask of its own.
- LED destination panels glow in the enhanced picture; "LED glow" and "LED masks keep
  their mipmaps" are settings (#324, by NACHN).

### Sound
- People walking in the street no longer sound as if they walked on a bus floor (the
  passengers' step samples, `Sounds\Passengers`, are for passengers aboard), and the stair
  samples are left out of the steps (#236).

### Game
- Teleporting to a street picked on the city map works across a big map: the navigator's
  lanes of the whole map are taken when the loaded tiles have no street there, and the bus
  waits at the street's height for its tiles instead of dropping through (#235).

## 0.1.323 - 2026-09-30

Crash reports from phones, a lost graphics device on DirectX 12, the vanilla night, and five
pull requests.

### Crashes and reports
- Phones: an app the system ended in the background (or that was swiped away) is no longer
  reported as a crash at the next start - most of the "closed without a word" reports were
  that. A report sent to GitHub carries the end of the log, and the whole report is on the
  clipboard as well; the renderer names each stage it compiles, so a report says where a
  driver gave up.
- A phone whose Vulkan driver went down while the shaders were being compiled (the reports
  that end at "cloud noise made") draws with OpenGL from then on (Settings → Graphics API
  takes it back).
- A graphics device lost on DirectX 12 starts the game again on Vulkan, as one lost on
  Vulkan starts it on DirectX 12. The launcher, too, makes its device again on the other
  interface instead of drawing on a dead one with thousands of errors (#274, an AMD Radeon).
- The automatic texture budget stays at 2.5 GB: since 0.1.237 a PC with 32-64 GB let the
  textures take 4-8 GB (#277).

### Pictures
- Vanilla: the texture times the light as Omsi.exe multiplies them, in gamma space - nights
  were several times too bright, a late dusk instead of the dark (#300).
- Night maps switch on with the street lamps, fully, as in Omsi.exe, instead of fading in
  with the dusk (a clear evening showed lit windows at a fraction, #276).
- Enhanced: chrome and other opaque sphere-mapped parts reflect again (#266, #264).

### Vehicles
- `[kmcounter_init]` starts the odometer at the bus's years in service times its
  kilometres a year (#305).
- Phones: a manual gearbox whose dashboard answers to the automatic's keys shows the manual
  gate (#279).
- The automatic clutch's help is for gearboxes that read the clutch pedal only: an
  automatic with number-key gears had its clutch pressed at stops (#234); a script without
  `engine_n` no longer keeps the clutch down for good (#260).

### Pull requests
- Merged: #298 (backwards meshes of exporters with a positive determinant: the Citelis'
  dashboard lamps, by ThiBot77), #307 (force feedback on Logitech and Moza wheels, by
  tistron), #310 (a warning when the driver uploads far too slowly, by ThiBot77), #313 (all
  buttons of a Linux wheel in the launcher, by ThiBot77), and #240's scenery-object support
  for HTML textures (by shloooo).

## 0.1.307 - 2026-09-30

Passengers, bus physics and light maps checked against Omsi.exe once more, and ten pull
requests.

### Passengers
- A bus that is not in service (no valid destination, or a "$allexit$" one such as
  Betriebsfahrt) or that stands at its own terminus empties there and takes nobody on, as
  Omsi.exe does (0x61f3e3). People boarded buses showing nothing; nobody got out at the
  last stop of a late trip (its stop index started again at 0 with the next trip - riders
  now go by the stop itself as well).
- Riders get up as the bus pulls in to their stop, not once it stands.
- Everyone on the way out holds the door request the whole way, as in OMSI: the automatic
  rear door no longer shuts on the next person walking up and opens again ("the door
  doesn't know whether people are getting off"). The requests are pulses, cleared after the
  vehicle's scripts each frame (0x7d6214): a timetable bus out of the passengers' reach no
  longer keeps its door open for good.
- The front of a queue stands aside while people get off: both used the same spot at the
  door and each waited for the other (#253).

### Physics
- `[momentofintertia]` on Omsi.exe's axes: roll is the third value, yaw the second (the
  SD202 rolled on 80 t m² instead of 300 - twice as fast, rocking over every uneven patch:
  the "boat").
- Speed bumps, cushions, manhole covers, lowered kerbs and slab edges are felt again: only
  faces under 2 cm over the road count as paint (4.5 cm took them away, and the bottom of
  every bump's ramp).
- When nothing is found under a wheel the ground is looked for up to 3 m above, as
  Omsi.exe's ground query does - a bus no longer falls through where it sank into a joint.
- An articulated bus's rear section rides on springs: a bump under its axle is a jolt.

### Light maps
- A light-mapped material is lit as D3D lights it: the material's own light and colour
  times every light - the saloon lamps included - clamped, then the light map laid on with
  ADDSMOOTH. The saloon lamps are no longer counted twice (flat white where both were on).
- Enhanced lays the light maps the same way: little by day, fully at night.
- Several maps on a slot chain as ADDSMOOTH and switch on at 0.5.

### Duties and traffic
- On a circular or turn-back route the duty no longer jumps to the stop over the road:
  stops are told apart by the direction the trip runs through them (#254).
- AI cars follow bends tighter than their model's lock instead of running wide through
  kerbs and corner houses (#249: 851 → 301 moments of a car over 1.5 m off its path in
  150 s of Spandau traffic).
- The view reset restores the zoom and the outside camera's distance (#244, with #281).

### Pull requests
- Merged: #237 (own number plate), #240 (HTML textures, by shloooo), #257 and #263 (AI
  bus displays and rear sections, by NACHN), #281 (H-pattern `kw_s_*_fest` gates, tour
  start and end in the chooser, by isaacsa2; #280 is the same), #282 (road markings and
  rails near the camera, by TruckiHD), #287 (tile light maps on their middle third, by
  Sulamufor), #288 (issue templates, by shloooo), #290 (mouse throttle reaches full, so
  automatic gearboxes kick down, by Sulamufor - taken without its build folder).

## 0.1.238 - 2026-09-30

Manual gearboxes, dashboard lamps, phones that crash or run slowly (#226, #231, #229, #225).

### Manual gearboxes (#226)
- With the automatic clutch on (the default), a gear chosen with a key, a phone's gear
  button or a controller comes with the clutch pressed and let up again, as OMSI's clutch
  key does, for gearbox scripts that only take a gear with the pedal right down and do not
  work the clutch themselves (the LiAZ and PAZ KPP: `(L.L.clutch) 1 =`). Before, a player
  without a clutch pedal - every phone - could not put such a bus in gear at all, forwards
  or backwards. Scripts that read `AutoClutch` (the Sprinters' G32) still do it themselves.
- The automatic clutch's pull-away help (the clutch bites as the throttle goes down, so the
  engine does not stall) works for these scripts' `antrieb_getr_gang` too, and is left to
  the scripts that work the clutch themselves.
- "Automatic clutch" can be switched in the launcher (Controls) and in the game menu; with
  it off, a phone shows its clutch pedal.
- The phone's gear buttons light the gear engaged for either kind of script.

### Dashboard lamps (#231)
- A `[matl_change]` variant shows as Omsi.exe shows it (0x5fd6xx): the variable rounded to
  the nearest whole number picks the `[matl_item]` (1 = the first), anything else the plain
  material - a lamp whose variable stands at 2 with one item is dark. A variable no script
  declares counts as 0, as the model loader registers it: the stock MANs' spare buttons
  (switched by `*Noch nicht belegt*`, "not assigned yet") and mods' door button lamps were
  lit all the time.

### Phones (#229, #225)
- The game's log is written on the phone too (`game.log` in the app's folder, the previous
  run's as `game-prev.log`), with the device's maker and model. A run that closed in the
  middle of a drive - a graphics driver taking the app down without a word - is shown by
  the launcher at the next start, with the end of its log for "Copy report".
- The first drive after such a closing starts with safer graphics, and on OpenGL when the
  one that closed drew with Vulkan.
- A phone's graphics chip always gets the light picture (no SSAO, no MSAA, small shadow
  maps), whatever type its driver reports.
- The automatic render scale has a fourth step, 55 %, for a chip that is still too slow at
  70 %.

### Checks
- `OMSI_DEBUG_VARS` with `OMSI_DEBUG_VARS_EVERY=<s>` logs the variables through an
  offscreen `--drive`; a manual gate given with `--triggers` comes with the automatic clutch
  as from the keys.

## 0.1.237 - 2026-09-30

The testers' second round: the crashes with "the graphics device was lost", weak cards and
phones, traffic that stood on free roads and roundabouts, passengers' necks, VR, gamepads,
and six pull requests.

### Crashes and graphics cards
- A lost graphics device (the driver reset the card: "the graphics device was lost",
  #219, #223) no longer ends the drive: the game saves the situation and starts again on
  it by itself with lighter graphics (no MSAA, no SSAO, smaller shadow maps, mirrors and
  texture budget; on Windows DirectX 12 when it was Vulkan that was lost), at most twice. The launcher does not
  report such a restart as a crash.
- Windows tries DirectX 12 before Vulkan.
- When the card runs out of memory, the textures are cut down (to 60 % of the budget each
  time, not below 300 MB) before the driver gives up.
- The interface's vertex buffers are made where a failure can be seen: after the card ran
  out of memory, one invalid buffer was written to every frame, flooding the log with
  thousands of GPU errors and taking the frame rate down to 12 fps (#217). A failed one
  is now made again at the next frame and nothing draws from it meanwhile.
- The automatic render scale moves in three steps (100, 85, 70 %), at most every five
  seconds. Every 5 % step every two seconds made all the picture's targets anew -
  hundreds of MB each time - a stutter and memory the driver ran out of. At the smallest
  scale and still too slow, SSAO and then the shadows go off.
- A small or shared graphics chip (integrated graphics outside a Mac, a phone, a card of up
  to 2.5 GB, OpenGL) is drawn without SSAO and MSAA; a card of up to 4 GB without SSAO and
  with at most 2x MSAA. `OMSI_FULL_GPU=1` keeps the settings as they are.
- The status log shows the GPU memory the textures and meshes take; on Windows the
  machine's memory sets the texture budget.
- Textures shrunk while far away come back whole at once when they are near again:
  buildings right in front of the bus stayed blurred on a map that filled the budget.

### Traffic
- A roundabout's entry no longer waits at its line for a gap at the far side of the ring:
  a nine-second gap that never came kept the queue standing for minutes (Westcountry: no
  car stuck any more, mean speed 13 -> 21 km/h).
- A hold of one frame winds a waiting driver's reaction back only a little: a junction
  "free, not free" by turns kept cars about to go for good, on open roads too.
- A car at the stop line when the light turns green goes; a green of a second let nobody
  through before.
- Nobody waits for a car of the ring that is itself creeping in a queue.
- `OMSI_DEBUG_STUCK` names the light programs and the hidden reasons a car holds.

### People
- Passengers who look at the bus turn their shoulders with it, and the head turns no more
  than 45 degrees on them. The people have no neck bone: a head turned 60 degrees on still
  shoulders twisted the neck.

### VR
- The bus's own head movement is off in the headset (the cab swayed before the eyes).
- The sphere-map reflections are laid out by the bus's heading, not by each eye's view:
  they no longer swim with every turn of the head.

### Controllers
- Gamepads (#200): the stick sets where the wheel turns to, on a gentler curve and less the
  faster the bus goes, and the wheel follows at a hand's pace; the bus no longer swerves
  with every touch of the stick.
- An Xbox pad on Windows named in OMSI's `gamectrler.cfg` keeps its sticks and triggers
  (#171).
- Force feedback (#224, #230, by tistron): DirectInput wheels have their own centring
  spring turned off before they are acquired, and again when they are acquired anew; the
  steering is lighter while turning, heavier when parking, centres itself under control
  and follows the bus's sideways acceleration; the front wheels' bumps and kerbs are felt
  as short vibrations (also in a gamepad's rumble). Steering force and vibration are set
  per controller under Controls -> Game controllers and kept in `Inputs/gamectrler.cfg`.

### Pictures
- Raindrops on the glass are lenses (#228, by Jaja80330): each drop shows the world behind
  it upside down and mirrors the sky; drops sit in three sizes on turned grids, a mist of
  droplets greys the pane, and runners slide down in fits and starts, wiping a track and
  leaving beads behind. Storms are denser and less regular (#222, by TruckiHD).
- `[rendertype] presurface` objects draw before the terrain, so excavations under the
  ground show through their invisible covers (#218 by TruckiHD, #215).

### Sound
- The player's bus's own sounds keep their pitch while the camera follows it: sound and
  listener were moved at different moments and the Doppler shift made them waver (#214,
  by TruckiHD).

### Launcher
- The timetable chooser shows the chosen trip's duration, in words as OMSI's BBS writes
  them (#233, by tistron).

### Checks
- `OMSI_AUTOPILOT=<km/h>` (offscreen): the player's bus follows the lanes and logs where
  it stands against the ground, for roundabouts and places buses fall through.

### Pull requests
- Merged: #214, #218, #222, #224 / #230 (the same commits), #228 (with #222's hash; its
  own patches replace #222's density field), #233.

## 0.1.221 - 2026-09-30

Everything since 0.1.178: the testers' reports from Fikcyjny Szczecin (MAN NL/NG Enhanced),
KS Węglin, Cotterell and The Adstow Project, multiplayer, the trains, ten GitHub issues and
six pull requests. Where OMSI 2 has the behaviour, it was taken from Omsi.exe itself (the
addresses are in the commits).

### Driving and physics
- The suspension is Omsi.exe's: the body hangs on a spring and damper at each wheel over the
  ground point under it (`achse_feder`, `achse_daempfer`, `Axle_Springfactor`, capped at
  `achse_maxforce`), with no tyre spring, wheel mass or bump stop of our own in between.
  Buses no longer float over the road "like a boat"; every bus drives on its own `.bus`
  values. (`OMSI_TYRE_SUSPENSION=1` brings the old model back for comparison.)
- The driver's head moves as in OMSI: thrown by the body at the eye, up and down always,
  sideways and fore and aft with `[driverview_moving]`, never more than 10 cm.
- Mouse steering switched off (right click, O, the menu) leaves the wheel where it is; the
  keys go on from there (#184).
- While the view is turned with the mouse, the cursor shows OMSI's four arrows (#185).

### Keyboard
- `Inputs/keyboard.cfg` is read as Omsi.exe reads it (#195): the third value's bit 1 means
  "the action follows the key's state" (throttle, brake, steering), 2 is Shift and 4 is Ctrl.
  The stock driving keys no longer need Shift; parking lights are Shift+L, the quicksave
  Ctrl+S, the screenshot Ctrl+Shift+P, the information display Shift+Y, the timetable Insert
  and the ticket desk camera Home. Rebinding a key in the launcher keeps the entry's own
  "held" bit; an Alt chord of our own is bit 8, which OMSI ignores.

### Pictures, lights and mirrors
- Material highlights are Direct3D's per-vertex specular term from the sun and the light
  above, as in OMSI: gear selectors, buttons and screens no longer catch sharp sun spots.
- `[matl_envmap]` on glass and paint blends as Omsi.exe blends it: windows are no longer
  mirrors of the street; the enhanced picture's glass reflects 4-12 %.
- `[matl_lightmap]` is on or off at its variable's 0.5 and is added to the light before the
  texture (ADDSMOOTH): lit saloons glow at night and hardly show by day.
- Mirrors and door monitors (the BMC Procity's `camera_TFT` among them) show what they
  reflect: each frame the ray from the eye to the mirror is reflected in the mirror's face,
  as Omsi.exe does; left mirrors, kerb-side blind-spot mirrors and middle-door monitors no
  longer look into the saloon or the sky (#192).
- A lamp's `[light_enh]` lights move with the mesh they belong to: a level crossing's
  barrier lamps stay on the barrier.

### Map objects
- Parked cars stand on the ground as Omsi.exe puts them, with the map's own pitch and bank,
  no longer tilted by the slope under them (Cotterell).
- Attached objects turn as Omsi.exe turns them (own rotation, then the parent's).
- The stop helper (`routearrows_busstop.sco`) stands on the stop object with its rotation;
  it no longer "cuts" into the bus beside it.
- A far AI bus keeps its destination sign instead of a flat colour beyond 50 m.
- Scenery whose free-texture filename is built in `{frame}` shows its texture (#198).
- `model.cfg` `[item]`/`[setvar]` are paint schemes of the model, as in Omsi.exe, and the
  chosen scheme's variables are there for the scripts' `{init}` (#190).
- Checks for road builders: `OMSI_CHECK_SPIKES`, `OMSI_HOLE_PHOTO`, `OMSI_ROAD_PHOTO_N`;
  `--cam` takes a field of view.

### Passengers and people
- Passengers get off where Omsi.exe sends them: each rider's stop is drawn among the stops
  ahead by the stops' "passengers alighting" numbers. They no longer all leave after one or
  two stops.
- Waiting passengers keep to their nearest door while it opens: a bus whose rear doors open a
  moment before the front one no longer sends the people at the front to the back.
- People on foot wait for a car or bus standing in their way on a crossing, then go round
  it, instead of pressing against its side.
- F2 reaches the passenger cameras of an articulated bus's rear section.

### Traffic
- Traffic keeps to the middle of its lane beside parked cars (narrow British streets, The
  Adstow Project).
- Random traffic keeps to its pool's path densities (`unsched_vehgroups.txt` pools with their
  own `[rule] trafficdensity`), and a positive density as low as 0.001 still lets cars on
  (#201, #199, from Aurora Studio). A car whose pool may go nowhere at a junction goes on
  where cars may instead of standing there.

### Trains
- `[trainreverse]` works as in Omsi.exe: a train whose next trip runs the other way is turned
  round where it stands - its last car leads - and goes on with the trip. The Berlin U-Bahn
  no longer drives off the end of its siding while another train appears for the trip back.
- Trains stop with their front at the station, as Omsi.exe measures it (half the train's
  length and the `[ai_brakeperformance]` holding offset): the S-Bahn and U-Bahn no longer
  stand half a car past the end of the platform. Train cars without `[boundingbox]` take
  their model's length (18 m, not 12 m).

### Multiplayer and servers
- No more micro-teleports: states are stamped with the moment of the frame they show, and the
  other players' buses and the host's traffic are drawn by a clock that runs smoothly
  instead of jumping with every datagram. Another player's bus: speed jitter per frame
  median 11 % -> 1.4 %; the host's cars at a client are drawn within 2 cm of where the host
  has them.
- A joining player sees the host's traffic and people whatever their own traffic settings
  ("passengers but no traffic" on a server).
- A server no longer stalls when someone drives a bus it cannot load: it tries again after
  half a minute, loads only the buses its `vehicles` list allows and shows the first of them
  for any other.
- Joining by code starts on the host's map.
- Session codes end in a full group of four characters (#152); old codes are still read.
- Each camera keeps where it was turned, as in OMSI 2.
- A door whose entry point lies on the aisle opens to the kerb: the left where traffic keeps
  left.

### VR (Windows)
- OpenXR VR support (#168, by EpixXx): stereo rendering with head tracking, a spatial Esc
  menu and cockpit pointer, right-click zoom, the headset picture on the monitor, its own
  settings and keys (Ctrl+Shift+R recentre, F7 monitor picture, F8 VR / desktop). See
  [docs/VR.md](docs/VR.md).

### Phones and on-screen controls
- With `OMSI_TOUCH=1` on a computer, the mouse works the on-screen controls as a finger
  (from #202).

### Translations
- Hungarian refined (from #143, by agost4002).

### GitHub issues closed
- #127 (an overlay layer drawn opaque), #151 (default specular), #152 (session code), #176
  (shiny windows), #184 (mouse steering), #185 (look cursor), #187 (envmap brightness), #190
  (`[setvar]`), #192 (mirrors and door monitors), #195 (keyboard.cfg bits).

### Pull requests
- Merged: #168 (VR), #198, #199, #201. Taken in part: #202 (the mouse as a finger; its fixed
  gear panel and the committed rustup installer were left out), #143 (the Hungarian lines;
  its edits to the English texts would have dropped those lines in every language).

## 0.1.182 - 2026-09-30

### Website
- Ko-fi was added alongside Buy Me a Coffee, and the site's corner Donate button opens a menu
  with both options.

## 0.1.180 - 2026-09-30

### Multiplayer
- Joining a server by code starts on the host's map even when the server welcome arrives after
  loading has begun; maps not installed locally can still come with the host's mods.

## 0.1.178 - 2026-09-30

Everything since 0.1.146. Where OMSI 2 has the behaviour, it was taken from Omsi.exe itself.

### Roads, splines and the ground
- Roads no longer disappear under the grass. Splines the map marks `[spline_terrain_align]`
  cut their outline out of the ground, as Omsi.exe does: whole stretches of Spandau's roads,
  the six-lane Falkenseer Chaussee among them, were buried. The cut is exact to a few
  centimetres: no sky along the kerbs, and narrow medians stay green.
- The ground is no longer taken away under every road in rough 1.5-3 m steps (the "holes in
  the world" beside kerbs and car parks); only where the map says.
- Road cant takes its width from the spline's height profiles, as in Omsi.exe.

### Vehicles
- Bellows of articulated buses bend with the rear section on slopes instead of away from it.
- Skinned meshes (bellows, levers of mod buses such as the AA-FR Agora) deform as in OMSI 2.
- Headlights in the classic picture shine forward from the lamps, one beam per headlamp,
  as bright as in OMSI 2, and no longer light up the bus's own saloon and dashboard.
- Roller-blind destination displays (`[texcoordtransY]`, `[matl_freetex]`, borders) work.
- Thüringer Wald buses keep their roof at night.
- Mirrors see closer and further (0.1 m to the objects' range, as Omsi.exe).

### Trains
- Trains are put together as in OMSI 2: every unit with its cars, the last car turned round
  (Berlin U-Bahn A3, S-Bahn BR 275).

### AI traffic and passengers
- AI cars no longer wait for each other for ever: a long wait at a side road now gets its
  turn, and two cars that each waited for the other drive on.
- Passengers at a stop no longer all stare at the driver: each watches a coming bus on their
  own, and only the people it takes keep looking once it stands.
- Timetable buses' door handshake follows Omsi.exe (a trace: `OMSI_DEBUG_DOORS=1`).

### Weather and administration
- Weather cycle (launcher, phone launcher, `weather = cycle` in server.cfg): a new weather
  every 25-60 game minutes, fitting the month; every weather change blends in over 4 minutes.
- Server admins: set any installed weather, switch the cycle on and off, clear jammed traffic.

### Multiplayer
- The official server: type `openomsi` to join "openOMSI | Official Server"; it is first in
  the server list.
- Any server address works: an IP, a host name, host:port or a link.
- Parked cars are the same for everybody: a car that drove off at the host is gone for the
  other players too (their buses drove through cars only one side had).
- Joining keeps the duty on the host's map; the launcher never hangs on a job that died.

### Phones
- A launcher made for phones: tabs at the bottom, a Play screen, full-screen choice sheets.
- Manual gearboxes on the touch controls, with a clutch pedal.
- Installing mods works again (it stood at "reading the archive's table of contents").
- On foot, the own bus answers clicks.

### Performance
- Less stutter when the camera moves (culling buffers are kept between frames).

## 0.1.175 - 2026-09-30

### Passengers
- Waiting passengers decide individually whether to watch an approaching bus, and once it
  stops only the people who intend to board it keep looking at it.

## 0.1.174 - 2026-09-30

### Trains and multiplayer
- Train and coupled-vehicle consists are assembled in OMSI's order, including reversed cars
  and couplings from every unit. The same orientation rules apply to the player, AI and LAN
  vehicles.

## 0.1.173 - 2026-09-30

### AI traffic
- A car that has waited a long time at a junction keeps its turn instead of being starved by
  every new arrival.
- Two cars that end up treating each other as their lead no longer wait for each other
  forever.
- A car committed to changing lanes is no longer held back by parked cars in the lane it is
  leaving.

## 0.1.171 - 2026-09-30

### Performance
- Main-view culling buffers are reused between frames, reducing allocation and camera-motion
  overhead without changing visibility or LOD decisions.
  [#175](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/175)

## 0.1.160 - 2026-09-30

### Roads and splines
- A spline type's half cant width is derived from its height profiles, as Omsi.exe does;
  splines without height profiles have no cant.

## 0.1.146 - 2026-09-29

### Scenery
- Scripted advertisements can be rendered on scenery objects.
  [#147](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/147)

## 0.1.144 - 2026-09-29

### Controllers
- Linux wheels get force feedback and stable button numbering.
  [#146](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/146)

## 0.1.139 - 2026-09-29

### Mouse steering
- A right click can end mouse steering again.
  [#162](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/162)

## 0.1.138 - 2026-09-29

### Diagnostics
- `OMSI_DEBUG_TRAILERS` logs coupled parts whose level does not match the vehicle pulling
  them.

## 0.1.136 - 2026-09-29

### Graphics
- Model-order vehicle drawing is off by default again after it exposed saloons through body
  panels on several buses; `OMSI_MODEL_ORDER=1` keeps the ordered path available for tests.

## 0.1.135 - 2026-09-29

### Scripting
- `$cutBegin`, `$cutEnd` and `$SetLength` round their counts like Omsi.exe, and `$*`
  repeats a pattern to fill the requested length.

## 0.1.133 - 2026-09-29

### Passengers
- Waiting passengers stop at the pavement instead of stepping into traffic, and people under
  shelters stand on the floor at their own height rather than on the roof above them.

## 0.1.132 - 2026-09-29

### Passengers
- Passengers choose buses from the stops and termini served by the timetable, as Omsi.exe
  does, instead of using the old random "take the next bus" rule.

## 0.1.131 - 2026-09-29

### Text and displays
- Text textures follow Omsi.exe's font rules for missing glyphs, clipping and glyph spacing,
  fixing destination words that could run together or be squeezed into a texture.

## 0.1.129 - 2026-09-29

### Graphics
- Vehicle materials follow Omsi.exe's fixed-function texture stages more closely, including
  environment maps, transmaps and model-order blend/depth behaviour.

## 0.1.126 - 2026-09-29

### AI traffic
- Cars no longer brake for the player's bus merely following behind them.
  [#139](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/139)

## 0.1.121 - 2026-09-29

### Diagnostics
- `OMSI_JOINT_ANGLE` can hold an articulated bus's rear section at a chosen angle in
  offscreen tests, making joints and bellows easier to inspect.

## 0.1.119 - 2026-09-29

### Passengers
- Passengers meeting an arriving bus step only toward the kerb and stay on the pavement
  instead of standing out in the road.
  [#123](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/123)

## 0.1.117 - 2026-09-29

### Graphics
- Bus `[matl_alpha]` modes are respected again, so alpha-tested cut-outs and overlay layers
  are not forced opaque by the body-depth repair.
  [#127](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/127)

## 0.1.116 - 2026-09-29

### Camera
- The outside-view zoom changes in steps again instead of compounding every frame and jumping
  straight to its minimum or maximum.
  [#126](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/126)

## 0.1.110 - 2026-09-29

### Maps
- Objects attached to splines are placed at their stored chain offsets.
  [#124](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/pull/124)

## 0.1.101 - 2026-09-29

### Graphics and startup
- The game and launcher try the requested graphics backend and then other available Vulkan,
  DirectX 12 and OpenGL adapters instead of giving up on the first device that cannot open.
- Windows asks switchable-graphics drivers for the high-performance GPU, and a complete
  failure now reports an error cleanly instead of panicking.
  [#97](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/97)

## 0.1.99 - 2026-09-29

### Localisation
- English interface strings remain the lookup keys, so renamed text does not silently lose
  every translation; the Hungarian improvements are kept.

## 0.1.96 - 2026-09-29

### Performance
- Main-thread frame time is reduced on busy maps.
  [#119](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/119)

## 0.1.95 - 2026-09-29

### Graphics
- Graphics cards with about 2 GB of VRAM give textures a smaller share of memory, avoiding
  device loss on maps such as Grundorf with MSAA, SSAO and shadows enabled.
  [#114](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/114)

## 0.1.92 - 2026-09-29

### Maps
- Map pitch and bank are converted into the world's rotation convention correctly, fixing
  scenery such as Thüringer Wald rock faces.
  [#117](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/117)

## 0.1.91 - 2026-09-29

### Materials
- When a material slot has several `[matl_change]` records, the item is shown while any of
  their variables is active, matching Omsi.exe.
  [#112](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/112)

## 0.1.87 - 2026-09-29

### Controllers
- DirectInput now logs why a force-feedback wheel could not get exclusive access or create its
  constant-force effect instead of silently running without forces.
  [#99](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/99)

## 0.1.84 - 2026-09-29

### Maps and graphics
- Only splines whose profiles are entirely overhead are excluded from the ground surface;
  walls, embankments and watersides still shape the ground.
- Mesh files are looked up beside their model first, and the vehicle body-depth repair keeps
  applying where it is needed.

## 0.1.79 - 2026-09-29

### Materials
- When several plain `[matl]` blocks address the same slot, a later `[matl_alpha]` can set
  the slot's alpha mode, matching OMSI's material handling.
  [#95](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/95)

## 0.1.78 - 2026-09-29

### Build
- `Cargo.lock` now records the Windows dependency used by `omsi-render` for DXGI.

## 0.1.68 - 2026-09-29

### Controllers
- Controllers plugged in while the game is running are detected again without periodic
  polling stutter, and DirectInput device names with non-Latin letters match their
  `gamectrler.cfg` entries.
  [#71](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/71)

## 0.1.60 - 2026-09-29

### Documentation
- The README links the modding guide, and the build guide documents the Android toolchain and
  build command.
  [#66](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues/66)

## 0.1.59 - 2026-09-29

### Documentation
- The format documentation now covers model LOD selection, transmap alpha, entry-point records
  and map tile numbering.

## 0.1.57 - 2026-09-29

### AI traffic
- A car stuck at a dead end leaves sooner when a queue is building behind it.

## 0.1.56 - 2026-09-29

### AI traffic and graphics
- UK AI car packs are visible again, their paint/transmap layers render correctly, and object
  LOD selection follows OMSI's model order.

## 0.1.55 - 2026-09-29

### Physics
- Stacked road markings are ignored as extra steps by the wheel-ground query.

## 0.1.54 - 2026-09-29

### Maps
- Tile numbers include repeated `[map]` entries, as in OMSI, and entry points are resolved on
  their own tile instead of a different tile with the same object id.

## 0.1.53 - 2026-09-29

### Audio
- Sound follows the system output device when headphones or a Bluetooth headset are connected
  or disconnected while the game is running.

## 0.1.52 - 2026-09-29

### Vehicles and maps
- A bus is put down on the surface its wheels should stand on near the entry point's height,
  rather than on the highest nearby surface such as a wall top or bridge deck.

## 0.1.51 - 2026-09-29

### Passengers
- Seated passengers on high seats let their feet hang naturally instead of stretching their
  legs straight down to the floor.

## 0.1.48 - 2026-09-29

### Passengers
- People keep to the floor at their own height instead of being placed on a roof or deck above
  them.

## 0.1.45 - 2026-09-29

### Localisation
- Fourteen interface languages were added, bringing the built-in total to eighteen, with the
  launcher and game-menu strings filled in and system fonts used for Chinese, Japanese and
  Hindi text.

## 0.1.44 - 2026-09-29

### Launcher
- The bus list is rebuilt only when its search, content or host list changes instead of every
  frame.

## 0.1.42 - 2026-09-29

### Graphics
- Puddle splashes are rendered as a widening, scene-lit mist instead of glowing sprite rings.

## 0.1.40 - 2026-09-29

### Controllers
- Pressing a controller button highlights it in the controller list, making bindings easier to
  identify.

## 0.1.37 - 2026-09-29

### Controls
- OMSI's held keyboard-pedal behaviour is available as an option: a tapped throttle or brake
  can keep its position until the opposite pedal is used.

## 0.1.34 - 2026-09-29

### Doors and spawning
- Berlin buses' rear doors close on Shift+2 again.
- An entry point whose marker lies below empty space places the bus on the ground above it,
  while real lower levels are preserved.

## 0.1.32 - 2026-09-29

### Website
- Buy Me a Coffee links were added to the README and project website.

## 0.1.31 - 2026-09-29

### Mirrors
- `reflexionN.bmp` camera pictures work wherever a vehicle material refers to them, including
  switched material items and light/night maps.

## 0.1.29 - 2026-09-29

### Traffic
- Barriers can open for the player's bus when it approaches off the traffic lanes, such as in
  depot yards.

## 0.1.27 - 2026-09-29

### Diagnostics
- Missing objects, splines and textures are reported by add-on in
  `~/.openomsi/missing_content.txt`.
- The game log records the system, launch settings, controls, views, pauses and regular runtime
  status so broken maps and sessions are easier to diagnose.

## 0.1.26 - 2026-09-29

### World
- A bus on a genuine lower level is no longer "rescued" onto a roof, and teleports that specify
  a height keep the intended level.

## 0.1.24 - 2026-09-29

### Controls and releases
- Door keys are assigned from the model's actual doorways and the triggers that move their
  leaves, fixing unusual mod door layouts.
- Release notes are generated from changelog lines added since the preceding release instead
  of falling back to a generic message.

## 0.1.22 - 2026-09-29

### Camera and controls
- Mouse steering can keep turning beyond the window edge, free-camera keys no longer drive the
  bus at the same time, and the mouse wheel zooms in free camera and on foot.
- Snow is matte instead of taking the wet-road gloss.

## 0.1.21 - 2026-09-29

### Physics
- A spline height profile far above the geometry it describes is taken at the drawn height
  instead of becoming an invisible wall; `OMSI_CHECK_WHEELS=1` can report what wheels meet.

## 0.1.20 - 2026-09-29

### Doors and controls
- Automatic rear doors close again instead of having their timer constantly restarted by
  waiting passengers.
- Wall tops stay walls, route numbers can be chosen correctly, and a force-feedback wheel
  recovers properly after a pause.

## 0.1.19 - 2026-09-29

### Graphics and diagnostics
- Automatic render scale stays at full size up to 4K on Windows and Linux.
- `OMSI_CHECK_SPLINES=1` can list spline chains whose ends do not meet.

## 0.1.18 - 2026-09-29

### Game and Discord
- The clock can be moved forward or back from the game menu, including an option to put a duty
  back on time with its timetable.
- Discord Rich Presence shows the current bus, map and line.

## 0.1.17 - 2026-09-29

### AI traffic
- A junction claim expires when its car has been crawling outside the junction for too long,
  preventing chains of traffic from waiting behind a stalled claimant.

## 0.1.15 - 2026-09-29

### Driving and vehicles
- Wheels prefer the road surface over terrain cutting through it, removing invisible bumps and
  walls where roads pass through the ground.
- Bus auto-start waits longer for delayed starters and can select D with the brake held.
- Manual gearboxes can be shifted with Ctrl+Up/Ctrl+Down, with an optional automatic clutch.
- Continued situations keep the livery, mouse steering survives a look-around, glance keys
  return to the road, and the bus can be moved from the map.
- The pause menu no longer flickers its top selection, and the phone wheel follows the bus wheel
  one to one.

## 0.1.14 - 2026-09-28

### More fixes
- Esc → More → *Set the clock...*: the clock one, five, fifteen or sixty minutes on or back,
  and on a duty *On time with the timetable* (early or late by six minutes: the clock is
  put where the bus is on time).
- Discord shows "Playing openOMSI" with the bus, the map and the line (Rich Presence, over
  Discord's local connection; `discord_app_id` in the settings, `discord_status=0` turns it
  off).
- AI traffic no longer stands for minutes on a free road: a car crawling in a jam of its own
  kept its claim on the junction ahead, and the cars that give way to it waited behind it
  in a chain (one Golf stood 81 s on Spandau; none now in four minutes of 80 cars).
- On a road the wheels stand on the road, as in OMSI: the terrain over or through the
  carriageway (an embankment the road runs under, ground poking through the asphalt) was an
  invisible wall under bridges and a bump that threw the bus.
- Mod buses with a lamp test after the key (the GX7767 E500 MMC waits four seconds) start
  with Shift+U: the starter is tried for longer; an automatic gearbox that takes D only
  with the brake held (ZF, `(L.L.Brake) 0 >`) is put into D by the auto-start.
- Manual gearboxes: Ctrl+Up / Ctrl+Down shift up and down (gear levers with a trigger per
  gate, `kw_s_1`...`kw_s_10`, `kw_s_N`, `kw_s_R`, as the LiAZ MKPP), the clutch let up as
  OMSI's clutch key lets it; with *automatic clutch* on, the clutch bites by itself when
  pulling away, as far as the engine keeps its revs. *gear_up* / *gear_down* for buttons.
- A situation loaded with *Continue* keeps the bus's livery.
- Mouse steering keeps the wheel and pedals while the right button looks round, as in OMSI.
- The arrow keys' look with a wheel is a glance: held, the head turns (at most 140 degrees);
  let go, it comes back to the road.
- Esc → More → *Move the bus on the map...*: click a street on the city map and the bus is
  put there (Ctrl+click on the map does it too, now also on a duty).
- The pause menu no longer flickers its top line while the mouse moves over it.
- Phones: the on-screen wheel turns the bus's wheel one to one.
- Windows and Linux: the automatic render scale draws at full size up to 4K (it drew a 4K
  screen at 58 %, and enhanced graphics looked like low-quality textures).
- Automatic rear doors (SD202, SD200 and the like) close again: passengers walking to the
  door or standing at the back of the queue kept asking for it, and the script starts its
  closing time again on every request. A request now opens a shut door; an open one is held
  only by somebody in the doorway, as by the light barrier.
- Walls with a height profile on their top (the stone and brick walls of UK maps) are walls
  to the wheels, not a road: where a wall's top met the road the bus drove up onto it and
  along it as the road fell away.
- A spline's height profile lying well over everything the spline draws (Westcountry's
  yellow surface marking: paint 10 cm up, height profile 50 cm) is taken at the drawn
  height: it was an invisible wall across the road. `OMSI_CHECK_WHEELS=1` with `--offscreen`
  lists what the wheels meet along the driving lanes (for map makers).
- Mouse steering turns on to the full lock past the window's edge: with the cursor at the
  edge, moving the mouse on outwards keeps turning the wheel (the width of the window is a
  smaller part of the lock the faster the bus goes, as in OMSI, and at 30 km/h the edge was
  a third of it); moving back gives that turn back first.
- The free camera (F4): its keys (W A S D Q E, Space, Shift, the arrows) no longer work the
  bus as well (W switched the wipers on), and the mouse wheel zooms there and on foot
  (Ctrl+wheel moves the camera on).
- Snow is matte: it no longer takes the rain's gloss and shines like plastic in the lights.
- Modding: a mesh can be lit by up to 63 interior lamps (the extra numbers on the lines
  after the four of `[illumination_interior]`; OMSI 2 reads the first four), PBR maps up to
  4096 px, and 32 lights per 25 m of the world instead of 16. What openOMSI allows beyond
  OMSI 2 is written down in docs/MODDING.md and on the site.
- Door keys: Shift+1, Shift+2 ... are the bus's doors front to back, found from the model
  (where each door leaf sits along the bus and which leaves each door trigger moves). The
  LiAZ's Shift+1 opened its middle and rear doors together and its front door had no key;
  a mod door script that mentions a closing variable while opening had its two leaves on
  two keys (one leaf moved, the other needed its own press). The game's log lists the keys
  of each bus ("door keys: ...").
- The release notes list what changed since the release before (they said "Small changes
  and fixes" for every release without a section of its own here).
- Phones: 60 frames a second by default (the settings took the PC OMSI's limit of 30 from
  its options.cfg), and dragging the view turns it the way the finger moves (it was the
  other way round, left for right and up for down).
- A bus on a lower level (a car park under a building, a road under a bridge) is no longer
  taken for one fallen through the world and put up on the roof: it has fallen only with
  nothing under it at all. A teleport to a place with a height lands on that level.
- A map that uses objects or splines that are not installed says so when it loads (how
  many, and the add-on folders they come from), and every missing object, spline and
  texture is listed by add-on in `~/.openomsi/missing_content.txt` (written again when the
  game ends, with the tiles loaded on the way). Holes, bare roads and white objects of such a
  map are a missing download, not a fault of the game - now one can tell.
- The game's log records the whole session: the system (OS, processor, memory), the command
  line and every setting at the start; then everything said on the screen, each view, pause
  and resume, every key action and door key, and a status line every minute (frame rate and
  the worst frame, where the bus is, its speed, the view, the time, the traffic).
- The bus is no longer put down inside scenery: an object no taller than a vehicle that
  stands for a third or more where the bus is put (a mod map's static buses in its depot,
  a sign) is taken away for the session, as the object editor takes one away (the map's
  files are not changed).
- Barriers (depot and car park gates on a light program) open for the player's bus off the
  lanes too: a gate whose lane starts up to 25 m ahead, the way the bus faces, is asked for
  (in a depot yard the bus stood beside every lane and the barrier stayed down).
- Passengers: the queue at a front door no longer goes on round the bus's nose (it stops
  short of the front and turns out along the kerb - people stood across the road in front
  of the windscreen, facing the bus), and a door shut for a moment no longer sends the
  waiting people away: they wait on 25 s after a door of the standing bus was last open
  (they turned away at once and came back when it opened again).
- Camera monitors: `reflexionN.bmp` is camera N's picture wherever a vehicle's material
  names it (its light map, night map, a `[matl_item]` switched on by the script), not only
  as the plain texture - monitors that show the camera once switched on were white.
- "Doors are open" follows what the passengers are told is open (`PAX_Entry/Exit<n>_Open`)
  - mods use `door_<n>` for other things, and a bus with its doors shut said they were open;
  "Air pressure is low" is no longer said with the tanks full (the spring brake is then held
  by the bus's own parking brake).
- The rear doors of the Berlin buses (SD, NL, EN/GN) close on Shift+2: switching their
  release off with the doors open shuts them at once, rather than when the passengers'
  last request has lapsed.
- An entry point whose marker lies under the ground (nothing under its height at all) puts
  the bus on the ground above it, not in the void under the map; a real lower level (a car
  park's floor) is kept.
- Settings → Controllers → *Force feedback and vibration* (and Esc → More → Options):
  switches the wheel's forces and a pad's rumble off altogether (a pad left plugged in
  shook all the time).
- Spaces on displays and signs: a font without a space character (many display fonts have
  none) leaves the width of a narrow letter between the words; the words of a destination
  ran into one another.
- OMSI's held keyboard pedals: Settings → Controllers → *Keyboard pedals stay where they
  are* (and Esc → More → Options). Tap the brake and it keeps that pressure until the
  throttle is tapped, and the other way round.
- Settings → *Reset all settings...*: every setting back to how it came (the language, the
  drivers, the key bindings and the game folder stay), after a dialog that asks first. The
  quality presets are under Performance.
- The bus radio also plays the stations of OMSI's radio plugins (SuperRadio's `.opl` and
  its lists under `plugins`): every stream address found there is a station, after the
  ones of `~/.openomsi/radio.cfg`.
- Controls → Game controllers: a button pressed on the wheel lights its line in the list for
  a few seconds, and the status line says which button it is and what it does - press it and
  give it an action right there.
- Railway signals clear for the player's own train as well (driven on the rails): its
  signals stayed at stop, as only an AI train ever asked for them.
- Puddle splashes are a mist of water - soft, lit by the scene, widening and thinning out as
  it sinks - instead of rings of glowing light flying off the wheels.
- Enhanced graphics: the sky is drawn again after a third of the way it waited before, so
  the clouds no longer drift and jump back into place when the camera flies fast.
- Launcher: the bus list is built again only when the search, the buses or the host's list
  change (it was rebuilt every frame, every name copied - scrolling it stuttered on phones).
- 14 more interface languages: Українська, Беларуская, Қазақша, Polski, Čeština, Magyar,
  Español, Português (Brasil), Italiano, Nederlands, Türkçe, 日本語, 中文 (简体), हिन्दी -
  with English, German, French and Russian 18 in all (Settings → Language), and every text
  of the launcher and the game menus the tables lacked now translated in all of them. The
  tables are in the program, so they work on every system (the machine translation, which
  runs on Macs with Apple silicon only, is not needed for them). Chinese, Japanese and Hindi
  are drawn with the system's own fonts. OMSI's own texts (key names, descriptions) show in
  English where OMSI has no such language.
- Shift+U after a crash starts the bus again: a bus under power whose engine had died was
  taken for a running one and "switched off" round and round ("Shutting down..." for good).
  An auto-start that has gone on for 20 s is begun again by the next Shift+U.
- The weather turning to snow (Next weather, or the weather file) no longer drops the bus
  through the world: every tile is read again with the winter textures, and while the one
  under the bus is away the bus is held where it stands (it fell, was put back in the sky
  and fell again).
- Passengers in an indoor station stand on its floor, not on its roof: walking, they took
  any surface over them for a kerb to step up on. They now keep to the floor within a step
  of where they are (a station's floor under its roof, a car park's level under the deck).
- Keys the player set in `Inputs/keyboard.cfg` are theirs, also when they edited the
  installation's own file: Z / X / C (the indicators), Shift+number (the doors), W A S D and
  the arrows no longer take over a key bound to something else. What counts as changed is
  told from OMSI 2's own assignment, built into the game, with Shift held as well.
- The hazard lights go off again (X, and the phone's hazard button): pressed with them on,
  the key let go of the indicator lever instead of their own switch.
- Seated passengers on a high seat (on a podium, over a wheel arch) let their feet hang as a
  sitting body does, instead of stretching the legs straight down through the seat's front
  to the floor far below.
- The bus no longer spawns floating on a wall's top: the place it is put down at is the face
  its wheels stand on near the entry point's height (a road, a deck, an underground floor),
  not the highest surface of the map's height raster there, which is a wall's top beside a
  pavement (London) or a deck over the road.
- The sound follows the system's output device: a Bluetooth headset or headphones connected
  while the game runs take the sound over, and disconnected, the sound comes back on the
  speakers (it had stayed on the speakers, or stopped for good).
- Maps whose `[map]` list names a tile twice (Westcountry 3 names 33 tiles twice): the tile
  numbers the map's files use count those entries, as in OMSI. Counted without them, every
  number after the first repeat named the wrong tile: rows of objects repeated along a road
  (fences, bollards, lamps) hung from another tile's row and stood across the road or were
  missing (3 of 1536 rows found their start on Westcountry 3, now 165, 159 of them where the
  map says), timetable tracks ran over the wrong tiles, and entry points were looked for on
  the wrong tile.
- An entry point is found on its own tile: a map joined from two (two towns you cannot drive
  between) repeats object ids, and choosing a stop in one town put the bus on the grass of
  the other, where the other object of that id stands.
- Road markings laid over road markings (where lines cross, a box junction over a lane's
  arrows) are no step for the wheels: every layer of paint is looked through, not only the
  first.
- Traffic of the UK car packs (WH UK AI: Westcountry, London and others) is no longer
  invisible, only shadows and lamps driving about: a mesh written before a model's first
  `[LOD]` belongs to that level, as in OMSI. These cars put their shadow there; as a level
  of its own it was all a moving car had.
- Their paint: a `[matl_transmap]` picture without an alpha channel is opaque, as Direct3D
  reads it (the cars' paint layer has a black 24-bit `transmap_null.tga` and was invisible),
  and a layer drawn over another mesh of the same shape keeps its blending (the baked
  shading over the paint had been made opaque: black cars, black roofs).
- An object's `[LOD]` level is chosen as OMSI does: the first level in the model's order
  whose size the object reaches, else the last. The stock Sv signals list their detailed
  level before their low one; sorted by size, the low one stood in close up and the signal
  vanished in the distance. A model with a single `[LOD]` is drawn at any size.
- A car that has reached a dead end goes after 25 seconds, even in view, when others are
  waiting behind it: a fire engine at the end of a dead-end street held a queue of fourteen
  cars for two and a half minutes, and the junctions before it jammed full (Westcountry 3,
  38 cars stuck for over a minute in five minutes of traffic, now none).
- No more sky showing through the road in stars and stripes at junctions: a spline made
  only of blended layers (Westcountry's lane darkeners laid over the junctions' painted
  ground) no longer cuts the ground away under itself; the ground is what it darkens.
- `OMSI_DEBUG_LAMPS=1` lists every traffic light object, the crossing it belongs to and
  those that name none (and so stay dark).
- Esc → Destination display → *Route number*: the route (line) number on the displays, from
  the depot file's routes and the map's timetable; the destination stays.
- Windows: a force feedback wheel (G29) no longer pulls itself to the middle after the pause
  (taken back by the game, its own centring spring came back on).
- `OMSI_CHECK_SPLINES=1` with `--offscreen` lists the map's spline chains whose ends do not
  meet (for map makers).

### Controllers
- No hidden dead zone on wheels any more: gilrs's default filters took 10 % of every axis (90
  degrees either side on a wheel of 1800) and held back small movements; Windows: the
  driver's own DirectInput dead zone and saturation are cleared, as OMSI does (PXN V99).
- macOS: a device with sliders or the simulation page's axes is read as a wheel from its HID
  elements even when SDL's list calls it a gamepad (HORI Truck Control System: accelerator
  and brake stayed merged and the steering had a gamepad's dead zone).
- The Controllers page offers the view actions for buttons: *view_look_left/right/up/down*
  (look round while held), the interior cameras, the views. OMSI's view actions on buttons
  work in the game.
- Force feedback in every view of the bus, not only the driver's.
- The mouse no longer freezes the picture: a gaming mouse's thousands of moves a second each
  looked for the switch under the cursor, and no frame was drawn while the mouse moved.
- Mouse steering shows a cross as the cursor, as in OMSI.
- Phones: the on-screen wheel turns one and a half turns to the lock, as a bus's does, and
  comes back by itself when let go.

### Game
- P pauses into the pause menu in a LAN session too (the session goes on for the others).
- The launcher starts the game that came with it, not a path remembered from an older
  installation (on macOS it kept starting a build of the days before the rename).
- Esc → More → *Depot file (HOF)...*: choose the bus's depot file by hand. Placing a vehicle
  asks for its livery and depot file.
- A bus that could not be loaded is tried once more, and the reason is shown on the screen
  (it started on foot without a word).

### World
- Parked cars have their paint (the paint scheme's pictures were looked for in the wrong
  folder and the cars stood white) and lean with an inclined street.
- A street running through an object's `[boundingbox]` (a bridge, a gantry, a hall) makes
  that box no wall: mod maps' invisible walls across the road.
- The automatic rear door closes: the passengers' request button was never let go, so the
  stop request stayed on. A passenger who cannot get in stops asking after a while.
- Passengers turn their heads about the middle of the neck (aXYZ man02's neck point lies at
  the back of his neck: the head swung off the collar).

### Crashes
- "RenderBundleEncoder::finish: Validation Error" after the card ran out of memory no longer
  ends the game: the part of the picture is left out.

## 0.1.13 - 2026-09-28

### Menu
- P opens the pause menu and resumes the game from it.

## 0.1.12 - 2026-09-28

### Driving and physics
- A bus spawned inside an obstacle can move out of it instead of being permanently stuck.
- Road paint close above another road face no longer lifts the wheels.
- With a steering wheel, the arrow keys look around as in OMSI.
- Ctrl+Alt+arrow turns the mirror being viewed, with the adjustment saved per bus in
  `mirrors.cfg`.

## 0.1.10 - 2026-09-28

### Performance and crashes
- Big mod maps (Grande Porto, Novi Sad) no longer freeze for up to two seconds while
  driving: the night copies of object textures (`night\` folder) were decoded on the
  thread that draws. They are now read with the rest of a tile in the background; the
  slowest object upload on Novi Sad went from 1760 ms to 24 ms.
- Fixed the crash "Error in Buffer::get_mapped_range: Validation Error" (Windows): the
  vertex updates of a frame no longer go through one staging buffer that could outgrow the
  graphics card's buffer limit.

### Driving and physics
- Steering no longer eats the engine's power: both front wheels turned by the same angle
  and the tyres fought each other, so at 60 % steering a bus barely moved and at full lock
  not at all. The inner wheel now turns further than the outer one (Ackermann) - buses
  and cars take tight corners at the speed you give them.
- Modded maps: the bus no longer hops over invisible things. Only solid objects (`[fixed]`,
  not `[nocollision]`) give the wheels a step to climb; the low collision meshes of helper
  and sensor objects did too.
- Trains stay on their track: a track under a bridge counted as a "neighbouring lane", and
  a train changed lanes down through the viaduct.
- The automatic rear door (MAN SD200, NL202/EN92) closes after the passengers are out:
  one passenger held up on the way out kept the stop request on for good.

### Vehicles and mods
- Add-ons that name their meshes from another folder than their model (Studio Polygon's
  `Configuration Files`, packs that borrow from the vehicle folder or the game folder) find
  them.
- The side mirrors show the bus's own flanks, as in OMSI (the outside-only meshes are drawn
  in the mirrors from the cab).
- Esc → *Destination display...*: choose any destination of the bus's depot file by hand
  (roller blinds, matrix displays, custom blinds).

### Controllers (macOS)
- Wheels and pedals are read from their HID elements: two axes of the same kind stay two
  (HORI Truck Control System: the brake pedal moved the accelerator), a 16-bit wheel uses
  its whole range (no dead zone of a quarter turn), and the simulation page's steering,
  clutch, accelerator and brake are read on wheels that use it.
- Windows: the hat switches (D-pads of wheel rims, Moza among them) can be given keys like
  buttons (*Hat 1 up* ... on the Controllers page).

### Settings
- *Throttle pedal strength* / *Brake pedal strength*: a softer or stronger response of the
  analog pedals (launcher, and Esc → Options).
- *Seat position*: the driver's eye forward/back, up/down, left/right, with *Reset the seat
  position* (launcher, and Esc → Options).
- *Camera collisions*: the outside camera no longer jumps in when something passes behind
  it (it is pulled in over a tenth of a second); switched off, it goes through everything,
  as in OMSI.
- The field of view applies to the free camera and the view on foot too.

### More from the players
- A bus put down inside an obstacle (a shelter's or a depot's collision box - GPM) is no
  longer held there: what it spawned in is left alone until it has driven out of it.
- Road markings are paint, not steps: a road face within 4.5 cm over another one (markings
  made as `[surface]` objects or as splines with a height profile - Horizon) no longer lifts
  the wheels, so the bus stops hopping over lines at stops and roundabouts. Kerbs stay kerbs.
- With a steering wheel the arrow keys look around again, as in OMSI (a G29's buttons set to
  the arrow keys turned the view there; here they steered).
- Mirrors can be turned: Ctrl+Alt+arrows in the cab turn the mirror you look at, kept per bus
  in `~/.openomsi/mirrors.cfg`.

### Passengers
- The aXYZ man in the grey jacket no longer looks as if his neck were broken: a head turns
  about a point under its middle, not about the `[links]` neck point at the back of the
  neck, which swung the head off the collar whenever he looked to the side.

### Head tracking and time
- Head tracking: Settings → *Head tracking* takes the head's pose from opentrack's
  "UDP over network" output (port 4242) - TrackIR, Tobii, webcams and phones through
  opentrack. `head_tracking_invert=yaw,pitch,roll` in `settings.cfg` turns an axis round.
- The clock can be changed gradually: hold Ctrl+Shift+Page Up / Page Down (faster the longer
  it is held), or Esc → More → *Clock +10 minutes* / *-10 minutes*.

### Interface
- P pauses into the pause menu (P or *Resume* go on); it was only a line of text before.
- The pause menu shows the everyday lines first (*Resume, Options, Line and tour,
  Destination display, City map, Timetable, Save, ...*); the rest is under *More...*.
  The mouse wheel scrolls the menu instead of moving the highlight, and only the line under
  the mouse is lit.
- The timetable shows departure times (a stop with a wait shows both), the trip number of
  the tour and the next trip.
- Android: dropdowns no longer close (or pick something) the moment they open.

### Lua plugins
- `omsi.info()` (map, clock, view, speed, delay, line, tour, trip, next stop, ...),
  `omsi.command(name)` (refuel, wash, repair, screenshot, save, weather, clock ...),
  `omsi.vars()`, `omsi.clock()`, `omsi.speed()`, `omsi.distance(x, y)`, and the events
  `key`, `next_stop`, `view` and `duty`. See [Plugins](docs/PLUGINS.md).

### Website
- A link to the Discord server on the website and in the README.
- The website shows the releases (with their notes and downloads) and the issues (open and
  closed, searchable, with their discussion) on pages of its own.

### AI traffic
- A car already in a crossing on its green no longer stops again at a light of a path it
  joins inside that crossing (the cross traffic's red, an invisible stop line mid-turn).
- Depot buses wear the repaint of their fleet number when the bus's `[number]` lists name
  one (a `.org` file per repaint); they were painted at random.
- The AI vehicles are heard round the camera: a free camera following an AI bus lost its
  sound 250 m from the player's bus.

## 0.1.9 - 2026-09-28

### Graphics cards and crashes
- A graphics validation error no longer ends the game: it is written to the log and the game
  goes on.
- "The graphics device was lost" (RTX 4060 reports, a few seconds into big maps) is the
  Vulkan driver giving up. On Windows the game can now draw with DirectX 12 instead:
  Settings → *Graphics API*, or *Use DirectX 12* in the launcher after such a crash.
- Graphics cards without Vulkan (GeForce GT 530 and other older ones) run the game: it asks
  Vulkan, then DirectX 12 (Windows), then OpenGL, and takes the first that draws. Settings →
  *Graphics API* chooses one; the Windows download brings DirectX 12's shader compiler.
- Phones where every mesh came out flat and far away (the bus in the launcher too): the
  shaders no longer read the objects' matrices in the way some phone GPUs get wrong.
- Cards below the usual limits get a smaller shadow map, and textures larger than the card
  takes are scaled down instead of stopping the game.
- When a game ends on an error, the launcher says so, with *Copy report*, *Report on
  GitHub* and, after a lost graphics device on Windows, *Use DirectX 12*.

### Collisions
- Only the objects OMSI makes solid stop the bus (`[fixed]` ones and poles). Signs on stop
  poles, gantries and the bridges of mod maps not marked so were invisible walls - under the
  bridges of Saint Servant, for example.
- Collisions with objects can be switched off, as in OMSI: Settings → *Collisions with
  objects*, or Esc → Options in the game (OMSI's own `no_collision` setting is taken over).

### Steering, pedals and controllers
- Mouse steering works in the outside and passenger views too, and the wheel follows the
  cursor smoothly: it crept on by itself and came back in steps.
- New settings, off by default: *Steering linearity* (the steering keys turn the wheel at
  OMSI's steady pace) and *Old Steering* (the wheel stays where you leave it, as in OMSI 2 -
  turn it back yourself).
- The clutch key works as in OMSI: the pedal goes down at once and comes up slowly.
- Settings → *Wheel rotation* and *Full lock at*: a wheel of 900° can steer like a real bus
  (the full lock at, say, 540° of the wheel), *Reset wheel settings* goes back to OMSI's
  (the whole wheel is the full lock). *Invert force feedback* for wheels that push the wrong
  way (G29).
- Settings → *Field of view* for the views from the bus (Default: the bus's own cameras);
  the mouse wheel, = and - still zoom as in OMSI.
- A steering wheel listed twice (Logitech G29: once as a wheel, once as a gamepad) is listed
  once, and *Use this device* on the Controllers page switches any device off.

### Multiplayer
- A joining game plays on the host's map when it is installed, whichever map was chosen
  before joining. On big add-on maps it often stayed on its own map - where nobody met it:
  - the host lists its mods for the joining players after it starts, which takes a while on
    a big map, and the joining game gave up waiting for that list after 25 s;
  - a host busy loading a heavy area answered later than the 3 s the joining game waited;
  - a dedicated server answered nobody until it had loaded its whole map.
- The host answers joining players while it loads its world, and a joining game stays in
  the session while its own map loads.
- A joining game with everything the host uses installed no longer needs 3 GB of free disk.
- Mods installed into openOMSI's content folder inside the OMSI 2 folder are passed on to
  joining players (they were taken for OMSI's own files).
- A player's info (bus, destination, display texts) always fits one datagram: long paths and
  texts made it too big to arrive, and the others never saw which bus the player drove.

### Maps and vehicles
- Parked cars, people and objects whose `Texture` or `model` folder is spelt with another
  case are no longer white or missing on Linux (TH_Zafira and others).
- The warning lamps' glass of the Thüringer Wald buses (S 315 UL, S 317 UL, O 550) and the
  MB O 407 is see-through again instead of a row of white tiles ("glas" is glass too).
- Free roam (no duty): people only board a bus that shows a destination, not one showing
  nothing or "not in service".
- Drive → *Depot file*: the depot file (HOF) can be chosen by hand; *Automatic* follows the
  map and the date.

### Sound
- A limiter on the whole mix: many loud sounds at once no longer clip (heard as squeaks and
  crackles).

### Launcher
- Icons missing on some phones: the launcher's picture atlas grows when a screen needs more
  room than it had (high-resolution phones).
- The README has an installation guide and what to do when something goes wrong.

## 0.1.8 - 2026-09-28

### Controls
- Changing a key on the Controls page now takes effect: the page says which driving keys are
  in use, and changing any key switches *Driving keys* to *Custom controls* by itself (before,
  with W A S D the edited keys were silently ignored).
- Keys you bind yourself now beat the ready-made layouts: with W A S D chosen, a D you gave
  to the gearbox is the gearbox, not "steer right". The layouts' extra keys (Z/X/C for the
  indicators, I for the saloon lights) no longer apply with Custom controls (C is OMSI's
  "look ahead" there again).
- **Space** looks ahead again (OMSI's `view_reset_all_directions`); it was swallowed by the
  W A S D layout. Every view keeps its own direction: turning the outside camera (F3) no
  longer turns the driver's head (F1).
- Zoom inside the bus: the mouse wheel, **=** / **-** and a pinch narrow the view in the
  driver's and passenger views, as in OMSI.
- Mouse steering follows Omsi.exe exactly, now including its pedals (throttle from the middle
  of the window to the top edge, brake to the bottom edge, no dead zone). Settings → *Mouse
  steering* makes it more or less sensitive (100 % = OMSI).

### Wheels, pedals, joysticks
- On Windows the game controllers are read through DirectInput, as OMSI reads them: every
  device Windows lists as a game controller (wheels with their makers' drivers included), up
  to 128 buttons, and force feedback on wheels - the centring that grows with the speed, the
  heavy steering of a bus standing still, and the scripts' shaking.
- Buttons are numbered as DirectInput numbers them (they were counted in the order they were
  first pressed), and every button of a device can be given a key: the list stopped at the
  ten that fitted on the page (T16000M).
- *Set up step by step*: turn the wheel to the left, press each pedal - the axes, their
  direction and combined pedals are found by themselves. A connected device nobody has set up
  yet steers with its X axis and says where to set it up.

### Multiplayer
- Hosting no longer stops working after a while: the router's port forwarding was asked for
  two hours and never renewed, and the rendezvous relay was asked every second and refused the
  host after an hour or two. The forwarding is renewed every 20 minutes, the relay is asked
  every few seconds with a growing pause after a refusal, and a Cloudflare tunnel that ends is
  started again.

### Launcher
- Phones: the launcher is drawn at least at the system's text size, the settings stand in one
  column, a finger on a list at its end scrolls the page on, page titles no longer run under
  the tabs.
- The OMSI 2 folder is found when openOMSI was unpacked into it (openOMSI keeps its own content
  in an `openOMSI` folder there), when the path is pasted with quotes, or when `Omsi.exe` or a
  folder inside the game is chosen; a folder that is not a complete OMSI 2 is reported with
  what it lacks.
- Timetable: changes stay while you move between lines and are saved together (*Save all*);
  *New line*; *Repeat* makes a whole day of tours (every *n* minutes up to a last departure).
- Settings → Graphics → *Reflection maps* switches the materials' reflections
  (`[matl_envmap]`) off.

### Sound
- Distance as in OMSI: full volume up to the `[3d]` reference distance, then falling as 1/d
  (DirectSound's law). It fell much faster, so most sounds were far too quiet.
- The bus's own sounds are no longer muffled in the cab unless they are other vehicles':
  interior sounds such as the indicator relay were cut to a quarter and dulled, and only came
  through with a door or window open.
- Footsteps outside are heard through the bodywork from the cab (and the saloon's from the
  street); people in the street sounded as if they walked inside the bus.

### Maps and vehicles
- Matrix displays drawn by scripts (script textures as the LED mask, `\S:n`, e.g. churaPixel/
  Krüger++ matrices) show their dots instead of a fully lit panel: a `[matl_change]` ahead of
  the slot's `[matl]` made it opaque.
- Objects put on a road spline (`[splineAttachement]`), such as an entry point or a stop, are
  found by their id: a Novi Sad start point was "not in the map".
- An entry point whose object comes out on another level than the map recorded (under a
  bridge) starts the bus at the recorded height.

### Game
- The depot file (HOF) follows the date as the map's chrono says: Berlin in 1994 has line 137
  where 1986 had 92 - on every map with chrono depot changes.
- Phone: the pause menu scrolls with the finger; a finger put down to scroll no longer picks
  the line under it.
- With V-sync one frame waits for the screen instead of two: less input delay.

### Builds
- New downloads: Windows ARM64, macOS Intel, Linux ARM64, and the dedicated server for Windows
  (x64, ARM64) and Linux ARM64. The launcher updates itself on all of them.
- The release notes on GitHub list what changed (this changelog) instead of a link to the
  code changes.

## 0.1.7 - 2026-09-28

### Driving physics as the .bus file makes it
- The bus now follows its steering the way OMSI's own physics does: it turns exactly as far
  as its wheels point and only slides when a bend asks more grip than the road has. Before,
  every bus turned at 70 % of what its steering asked, 0.8 s late and drifting sideways -
  the "boat" feeling, and the same for every bus.
- Springs, dampers and their limits act where OMSI takes them (`achse_feder`,
  `achse_daempfer`, `achse_maxforce`, `achse_minwidth`/`achse_maxwidth`), every axle steers
  towards `[rot_pnt_long]`, and body pitch and roll are damped as in OMSI. Each bus feels as
  its author made it: stiffer springs, stronger dampers, a higher centre of gravity all show.
- `cargo run --release -p omsi-sim --example handling -- <file.bus>` prints how a bus
  handles (yaw response, side slip, body roll and how fast it settles).

### Steering
- Mouse steering (O) as in OMSI: the whole window width is the full lock, and above 10 km/h
  the same hand movement turns the wheel less and less (at 50 km/h a fifth as far). No more
  jumps when the cursor passes the middle.
- Phone: the on-screen wheel turns with the finger round it (a third of a turn is the full
  lock). It used to stop at about half a turn and spring back.

### Graphics and world
- Mirrors follow the bus's pitch and roll, use the camera distance from the `.bus` file, and
  only the mirrors in view are redrawn (the radius of `[add_camera_reflexion_2]`).
- The bus's own screens (IBIS, matrix displays, dashboard LCDs) are sharp again in Enhanced
  graphics: FXAA and the glow no longer blur them.
- Trees have the width the map gives them: slim trees such as firs were drawn up to six
  times too wide.
- Map tiles of older editor versions are read correctly (object tilt and strings).

### Updates
- The launcher updates itself from the GitHub releases: when a newer version is out it asks
  at the start, downloads it (checked against GitHub's SHA-256), replaces the program and
  starts again. Mods, content and settings stay as they are.
- On Android the system's installer is used: Update replaces the app and starts it again,
  Cancel leaves it as it was.
- Settings → Updates: look for updates at the start, install without asking, Check now.

### Fixes
- Android: vibration of the on-screen buttons works (the calls never reached the app).
- Android: `openOMSI/env.txt` takes the `OMSI_*` switches a computer takes from its
  environment (for looking into problems).

## 0.1.6 - 2026-09-27
- Phone: the on-screen wheel is drawn cleanly; calmer steering, tilt steering reaches the
  full lock at 45°.
- A version built again updates its release instead of failing.

## 0.1.5 - 2026-09-27
- Lua plugins (`plugins/<name>.lua` or `plugins/<name>/main.lua`) on every platform, next to
  the original DLL plugins: bus variables and triggers, events, timers, saved data, hot
  reload, sandboxed. See [docs/PLUGINS.md](docs/PLUGINS.md).

## 0.1.4 - 2026-09-27
- Android: the launcher and the game on phones and tablets, with on-screen driving controls
  (wheel or tilt, pedals, gearbox, doors, indicators, cab panel, cameras). See
  [docs/ANDROID.md](docs/ANDROID.md).

## 0.1.3 - 2026-09-27
- Small changes.

## 0.1.2 - 2026-09-27
- Website and repository improvements and fixes.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-09-27
- Website and repository improvements and fixes.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-09-27
- First public release as openOMSI: a from-scratch recreation of OMSI 2 in Rust that runs
  every map and mod (an original OMSI 2 is needed). Builds for Windows, macOS and Linux and
  a dedicated server, released automatically on every push.
